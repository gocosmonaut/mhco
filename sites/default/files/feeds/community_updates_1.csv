Let's not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.</p><p>What do the Regulations say?  ""...The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] ... must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community.  Such updates must take place once every two years ....""</p><p>For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome.  HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information ""will be readily available in the files.""</p><p>This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date).  One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement.  HUD emphasizes that ""...the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again â€“ only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.""</p><p>It is also clear that the survey is a ""summary"" and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident's file): ""[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation.  The word 'summary' has been added to this section"").</p><h2>Compilation of the ""Summary""</h2><p>In review of the files to compile the required ""summary,"" it is possible that some files may be missing POA (Proof of Age) documentation.  Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy.  This can be fatal to defending a ""55+"" status.  Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent.  Perhaps a resident's tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to ""grandfather"" underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant's age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced.  None of these explanations will ""wash"" with fair housing enforcers.  Now is the time for review of this information.  Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the ""55+"" status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation.  HUD's requirements are crystal clear: ""The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.""</p><h2>Should you seek missing POA information?</h2><p>Yes.  In a large scale review of resident files by fair housing enforcers, the main objective for review of proof of age may be to establish the 80-20 ratio: Proof of age in the file may itself be seen as evidence of adherence to collection of required data:  even after-acquired information reflects, at least, compliance with the 2-year survey requirement.  Proof of age includes</p><p>the following: driver's license (an expired or out-of-state license seems 'ok'), birth certificate, passport, immigration card, military identification, any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of ""comparable reliability.""  This may include birth certificates, baptismal or marriage documents, perhaps, and other public records.</p><h2>What if the tenant refuses to provide proof of age?</h2><p>New purchaser:  Of course, refusal to supply proof of age when applying for tenancy is a basis for denying a tenancy application.  The regulations also allow for a declaration from a member of the household over 18 years of age, stating that at least one person in the homesite is at least 55 years of age.  This after-acquired information is permissible for the survey, but again does not bolster evidence of conformance to proof of age documentation required for tenancy approval.</p><p>HUD provides a skeletal sample of certification.  This can also be used as part of the tenancy application alone or better yet as a backup to production of proof of age.  The sample reads as follows: ""I, (name), am 18 years of age or older and a member of the household that resides at (housing facility or community), (unit number or designation).  I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge of the ages of the occupants of this household and that at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older.""  Actual proof of age should be obtained at the application stage to avoid false reporting â€“ no defense to a failure to achieve the 80-20 ration.</p><p>The regs also allow for other proof of age if an existing resident refuses to provide it.  HUD states that ""[I]f the occupants ... refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the [management] may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.  Such evidence may include: (1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census; (2) Prior forms or applications; or (3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants.  The individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.""</p><p>Thus, the survey could be supplemented by including a sworn declaration or affidavit by any person with personal knowledge of the age of the resident's age.  In past cases where proof of age was critically important, private investigation of public records to obtain that information has been conducted to provide such knowledge.  Remember however, that obtaining proof of age ""after the fact"" shows compliance with the 2-year survey requirement, but does not substitute for a consistent practice of securing the required information at the time of processing the tenancy application.</p><p>HUD gives the following example as acceptable: ""the owner of a mobile home park where the residents own the coach but rent the land requires a statement of whether at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older before any sublease or new rental.""  In other words, the qualification procedure can be instituted within the application process itself.  HUD states such an example (""All new leases, new purchase agreements, or new applications contain a provision directly above the signatory line for leases, asserting that at least one occupant or the swelling will be 55 years of age or older.  In addition the community surveys all current residents for their occupancy status in compliance with the 55â€“or-older requirements"").  Actual proof of age should always be required with submission of the tenancy application as well.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The continuing survey requirement is mandatory.  Whether failure to comply will be fatal to the assertion of ""older persons"" status is unknown, but this survey requirement is part of the ""intent"" prong of operating an ""older persons"" community.  In sum, it is time to compile the summary for your park.</p><p>(Reprinted with permission from MHI)</p><h2>Do you operate a 55 &amp; Older Community?</h2><h2>Do you have the necessary MHCO Forms for 55 &amp; Older Communities?</h2><h2>MHCO has the Resources You Need!</h2><p>If you are one of the many members of MHCO who own and operate a 55 &amp; Older manufactured home community - MHCO has the resources you need to keep that community compliant with current HUD rules.</p><ul><li>Addendum      to the Rent/Lease Agreement for Age 55 &amp; Older Communities (MHCO Form      71A)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community - Occupation Determination and Age Verification      (MHCO Form 71B)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community HUD Verification of Occupancy Survey (MHCO Form 71C)</li></ul><p>These are excellent tools to use in the effective management of your 55 &amp; Older community.

Dowdall, Esq.</strong></p><p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status."" In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class. This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement. This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p><h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination. Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity. Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms? A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a test-case. In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following. If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul>	<li>Children under the age of fourteen (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Children under the age of eight (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of the family residence;</li>	<li>Children shall not be allowed to play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li>	<li>Residents and visitors under the age of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy. These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning â€“ No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol>	<li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li>	<li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li>	<li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li>	<li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine â€“ in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li>	<li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service â€“ disseminating information and facts â€“ not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five. Consumers should keep a locked safety cover on the spa whenever it is not in use and keep children away unless there is constant adult supervision. Hot Tub Temperatures â€“ CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa. High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning. In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death. In 1987, CPSC helped develop requirements for temperature controls to make sure that spa water temperatures never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Pregnant women and young children should not use a spa before consulting with a physician. ...

While the majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries are traffic-related, children ages 0 to 2 are more likely to suffer non-traffic-related pedestrian injuries, including those occurring in driveways, parking lots or on sidewalks. Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe. Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission. Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from trafficâ€“related pedestrian death and injury.

Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that between 1985 and 1989, the latest period for which data are available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers because of contact with exercise bikes. Most children were under the age of five. Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly. The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious. Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes. Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it. Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""

Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the seller of the manufactured home.</p><p>If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.</p><p>It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.</p><p>It is important that you advise anyone that has a ""For Sale"" sign on their manufactured home that they do the three things listed at the beginning of this section.  Failure by the prospective resident to fill out an application or the landlord's failure to advise them that they do not qualify can be a very costly mistake in the event they move in and then you give them notice.  It makes for ill feelings for everyone involved.</p><p>If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.

Simply tell them that you cannot accept the rent until they fill out an application and are accepted by the landlord.   <strong>DO NOT HAVE ANYONE SIGN A RENTAL AGREEMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE RUN CREDIT, RENTAL AND CRIMINAL CHECKS ON THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED</strong>.

Use the Park Rules &amp; Regulations as a briefing tool.  The conversation should not be a ""laying down of the law"", but rather an open discussion of what is expected of both the new resident and community management.  New residents may not know their responsibilities (despite signing numerous documents outlining their rights/responsibilities), thus it is your responsibility to clarify and remind them of their responsibilities.  Be sure your new resident understands such things as:</p><ol><li>Rent is due on the first of each month:<ol><li>If rent is paid after the 5th day, the residents will be faced with a late fee.</li><li>If not paid by the 8th day, the resident will receive a 72-hour notice.</li><li>Residents must give 30 days written notice to vacate space or they intend to sell their manufactured home.</li></ol></li><li>Help your new resident be a good neighbor.

Existing tenants who have not previously received a copy of the Statement of Policy and are on month-to-month rental agreements must receive their copy at the time the next 90-day rent increases notice is issued (ORS 90.510(3)(b). All other existing tenants shall receive a copy of the statement of policy upon expiration of their current rental agreement and before signing a new agreement.</p><p>While a Statement of Policy is not technically a contract, it is an important document.  A tenant or rental applicant who makes their decisions or changes their position in reliance upon the policies set forth in the statement may be entitled to hold the landlord to those written policies.  As proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy to tenants or applicants, it is advised to get a signed receipt.</p><p>A landlord who intentionally and deliberately fails to provide a Statement of Policy as required by ORS 90.510, or delivers a legally defective one, may be subject to a lawsuit.</p><p>The Statement of Policy is required to include the following information in summary form:</p><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;""><li>The location and approximate size of the space to be rented.</li><li>The federal fair housing age classification and present zoning that affect the use of the rented space.</li><li>The facility policy regarding rent adjustment and a rent history for the space to be rented.

If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.</em> Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.</p><p>When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, <strong>always</strong> give them an application packet.

Include in the application packet an application and ""Minimum Criteria Standards"", optional information may include what homes are available in the community, a community newsletter, information on the history of the community, the advantages of living in a manufactured home community etc. You may also want to include at this time a copy of the rental/lease agreement, rules and regulations, rent history, and statement of policy. Remember, you want to sell the prospective resident on your community, but you also want them to make a well informed decision.</p><p>Providing a prospective resident's with extensive information regarding your manufactured home community allows the applicant to evaluate for themselves if they qualify.

This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your ""Screening Criteria"" is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  That is up to you.  Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial â€“ it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example â€“ maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older â€“ it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.</p><p>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations â€“ write a ""screening criteria"" and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone â€“ even if they are in a protected class â€“ if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will ""self screen"" themselves by reading your ""screening criteria"" and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.</p><p>Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance.  This may include:</p><ul><li>Unsatisfactory rental references</li><li>Applicant must be 18 years or older</li><li>Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant's photo from a government office (i.e. Driver's License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card</li><li>Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.</li><li>If the community is either an ""age 55 or older"" or an ""age 62 or older"" Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements</li><li>The absence of any prior tenant history or credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory character references</li><li>Any criminal history</li><li>Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations</li><li>Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets</li><li>Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items</li><li>If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement</li><li>The number of additional occupants</li><li>Adverse information contained in the public record</li></ul><p>Additional criteria that may be added to qualify could include:</p><ul><li>Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords</li><li>No payment of rent problems over the past two years</li><li>Two years of verifiable employment</li><li>No criminal convictions</li><li>No tax liens</li><li>Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent</li><li>Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy</li><li>Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.</li><li>If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed.  Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs.  You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community</li><li>You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.</li><li>Homes must be owner occupied â€“ no subleasing</li></ul><p>You MUST post your community's screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.</p><p><strong>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions!</strong> Once you make an exception for one of your criteria you are opening up the possibility of future problems.  You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations and do not make exceptions to your screening criteria.  Take the time to put your screening criteria in writing to protect yourself and provide prospective residents with a copy so that they can have the necessary information upon which to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Remember â€“ you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or source of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone â€“ even if they are in a protected class â€“ if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.</strong></p><p>For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic.  However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.</p><p>Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law.

Much of what you may or may not be able to do in your community will be addressed in the rental agreement.</p><p>Although many residents in your community may have rental agreements that are 5 or 10 years old, residents moving in to your community must be given a current rental agreement that conforms with the most recent amendments of Residential Landlord and Tenant Act and Federal Fair Housing Act.  MHCO form '5A', ""Manufactured Dwelling Space Rental Agreement/Dispute Resolution Addendum"" (for month to month tenancies) and MHCO form '5B', ""Manufactured Dwelling Space Lease Agreement/Dispute Resolution Addendum"" are available through MHCO or you may have a rental agreement drafted by your attorney.</p><p>The Oregon Legislature occasionally adopts revisions to the Landlord and Tenant Act.

You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.

Exemptions for specific industries have been granted as late as the first week of December 2010.  MHCO and MHI are conducting research on this topic and will be providing additional information as it becomes available.  The Federal Trade Commission  link is http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/redflagsrule/index.shtml   and contains a lot of information that should be of interest to community owners and manufactured home community retailers.  If you are subject to the new rule there is a template developed by the FTC for businesses at low risk for identity theft at this site.  While we are still looking into this and monitoring developments in the Congress, it is likely that if a community owner is not billing for utilities, is not providing loans for residents purchasing homes, and is not acting as a retailer selling homes, they are not probably covered by the Red Flags Rule.</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule: What You Need to Know</h2><p>As of June 1, 2010 the Federal Trade Commission has begun enforcement of the 'Red Flags' rule which mandates creditors and financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs. It's important to spend some time discussing the rule, including what it is and what it means for you</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Ruleâ€”In Plain English</h2><p>The full title is this: ""Identity Theft Red Flags and Address Discrepancies under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003"" (FACT). It amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The rule was written specifically for companies making loans, such as banks and commercial lending institutions, but a portion of it extends to rental property owners and managers since both rely on consumer reports (e.g. credit) that (1) ask for sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and (2) could turn up address discrepancies. The philosophy behind this rule is simple: sensitive information must be kept secure to prevent identity theft, and a discrepancy in address could indicate fraud.</p><p>The rule requires that ""reasonable"" policies be in place to prevent identity theft and to verify a person's identity when an address discrepancy is reported. In the case of address discrepancy, if the property manager can't work out the discrepancy, the rule says he/she is not to rent to this individual.</p><h2>What the Red Flags Rule Means for Rental Owners &amp; Property Managers</h2><p>While the rule has caused some confusion, compliance is straightforward. More than likely, you're probably already in compliance since the only thing that rental owners or property managers have to show is that they have a ""reasonable"" process in place for preventing identity theft and for checking IDs, verifying IDs, and following up/asking about any discrepancies.</p><p>For example, how do you destroy electronic and paper records that contain sensitive information? Or how about this: if someone gives one address on his or her rental application, but the license lists another address, what's your policy for handling this situation? As long as you have reasonable policies in place, you're in compliance.</p><h2>Do I need to create a special report if I suspect fraud?</h2><p>The other commonly asked question about the Red Flags rule (beyond ""how do I comply"") is this: do we need to report suspected fraud? The answerâ€”for better or worseâ€”is no. If you believe someone is trying to perpetrate a fraud, there's no requirement beyond not renting to this individual.</p><h2>Still Unsure About the Red Flags Rule? Contact Your Screening Partner</h2><p>Laws, rules, and amendments result in legitimate questions and concerns, so we understand people's trepidation regarding the Red Flags rule. While it's true that you're likely already in compliance, it can't hurt to contact your screening partner and ask to review with them your policies and systems.</p><p>For full details, visit the FTC website at <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule</a></p><p>The information in this article should not be construed as legal advice.
