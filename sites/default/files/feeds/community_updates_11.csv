Let's not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.</p><p>What do the Regulations say?  ""...The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] ... must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community.  Such updates must take place once every two years ....""</p><p>For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome.  HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information ""will be readily available in the files.""</p><p>This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date).  One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement.  HUD emphasizes that ""...the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again  -  only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.""</p><p>It is also clear that the survey is a ""summary"" and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident's file): ""[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation.  The word 'summary' has been added to this section"").</p><h2>Compilation of the ""Summary""</h2><p>In review of the files to compile the required ""summary,"" it is possible that some files may be missing POA (Proof of Age) documentation.  Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy.  This can be fatal to defending a ""55+"" status.  Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent.  Perhaps a resident's tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to ""grandfather"" underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant's age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced.  None of these explanations will ""wash"" with fair housing enforcers.  Now is the time for review of this information.  Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the ""55+"" status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation.  HUD's requirements are crystal clear: ""The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.""</p><h2>Should you seek missing POA information?</h2><p>Yes.  In a large scale review of resident files by fair housing enforcers, the main objective for review of proof of age may be to establish the 80-20 ratio: Proof of age in the file may itself be seen as evidence of adherence to collection of required data:  even after-acquired information reflects, at least, compliance with the 2-year survey requirement.  Proof of age includes</p><p>the following: driver's license (an expired or out-of-state license seems 'ok'), birth certificate, passport, immigration card, military identification, any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of ""comparable reliability.""  This may include birth certificates, baptismal or marriage documents, perhaps, and other public records.</p><h2>What if the tenant refuses to provide proof of age?</h2><p>New purchaser:  Of course, refusal to supply proof of age when applying for tenancy is a basis for denying a tenancy application.  The regulations also allow for a declaration from a member of the household over 18 years of age, stating that at least one person in the homesite is at least 55 years of age.  This after-acquired information is permissible for the survey, but again does not bolster evidence of conformance to proof of age documentation required for tenancy approval.</p><p>HUD provides a skeletal sample of certification.  This can also be used as part of the tenancy application alone or better yet as a backup to production of proof of age.  The sample reads as follows: ""I, (name), am 18 years of age or older and a member of the household that resides at (housing facility or community), (unit number or designation).  I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge of the ages of the occupants of this household and that at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older.""  Actual proof of age should be obtained at the application stage to avoid false reporting  -  no defense to a failure to achieve the 80-20 ration.</p><p>The regs also allow for other proof of age if an existing resident refuses to provide it.  HUD states that ""[I]f the occupants ... refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the [management] may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.  Such evidence may include: (1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census; (2) Prior forms or applications; or (3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants.  The individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.""</p><p>Thus, the survey could be supplemented by including a sworn declaration or affidavit by any person with personal knowledge of the age of the resident's age.  In past cases where proof of age was critically important, private investigation of public records to obtain that information has been conducted to provide such knowledge.  Remember however, that obtaining proof of age ""after the fact"" shows compliance with the 2-year survey requirement, but does not substitute for a consistent practice of securing the required information at the time of processing the tenancy application.</p><p>HUD gives the following example as acceptable: ""the owner of a mobile home park where the residents own the coach but rent the land requires a statement of whether at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older before any sublease or new rental.""  In other words, the qualification procedure can be instituted within the application process itself.  HUD states such an example (""All new leases, new purchase agreements, or new applications contain a provision directly above the signatory line for leases, asserting that at least one occupant or the swelling will be 55 years of age or older.  In addition the community surveys all current residents for their occupancy status in compliance with the 55 - or-older requirements"").  Actual proof of age should always be required with submission of the tenancy application as well.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The continuing survey requirement is mandatory.  Whether failure to comply will be fatal to the assertion of ""older persons"" status is unknown, but this survey requirement is part of the ""intent"" prong of operating an ""older persons"" community.  In sum, it is time to compile the summary for your park.</p><p>(Reprinted with permission from MHI)</p><h2>Do you operate a 55 &amp; Older Community?</h2><h2>Do you have the necessary MHCO Forms for 55 &amp; Older Communities?</h2><h2>MHCO has the Resources You Need!</h2><p>If you are one of the many members of MHCO who own and operate a 55 &amp; Older manufactured home community - MHCO has the resources you need to keep that community compliant with current HUD rules.</p><ul><li>Addendum      to the Rent/Lease Agreement for Age 55 &amp; Older Communities (MHCO Form      71A)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community - Occupation Determination and Age Verification      (MHCO Form 71B)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community HUD Verification of Occupancy Survey (MHCO Form 71C)</li></ul><p>These are excellent tools to use in the effective management of your 55 &amp; Older community.

Dowdall, Esq.</strong></p><p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status."" In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class. This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement. This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p><h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination. Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity. Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms? A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a test-case. In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following. If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul>	<li>Children under the age of fourteen (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Children under the age of eight (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of the family residence;</li>	<li>Children shall not be allowed to play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li>	<li>Residents and visitors under the age of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy. These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning â€“ No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol>	<li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li>	<li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li>	<li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li>	<li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine â€“ in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li>	<li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service â€“ disseminating information and facts â€“ not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five. Consumers should keep a locked safety cover on the spa whenever it is not in use and keep children away unless there is constant adult supervision. Hot Tub Temperatures â€“ CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa. High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning. In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death. In 1987, CPSC helped develop requirements for temperature controls to make sure that spa water temperatures never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Pregnant women and young children should not use a spa before consulting with a physician. ...

While the majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries are traffic-related, children ages 0 to 2 are more likely to suffer non-traffic-related pedestrian injuries, including those occurring in driveways, parking lots or on sidewalks. Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe. Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission. Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from trafficâ€“related pedestrian death and injury.

Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that between 1985 and 1989, the latest period for which data are available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers because of contact with exercise bikes. Most children were under the age of five. Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly. The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious. Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes. Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it. Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""

Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the seller of the manufactured home.</p><p>If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.</p><p>It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.</p><p>It is important that you advise anyone that has a ""For Sale"" sign on their manufactured home that they do the three things listed at the beginning of this section.  Failure by the prospective resident to fill out an application or the landlord's failure to advise them that they do not qualify can be a very costly mistake in the event they move in and then you give them notice.  It makes for ill feelings for everyone involved.</p><p>If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.

Simply tell them that you cannot accept the rent until they fill out an application and are accepted by the landlord.   <strong>DO NOT HAVE ANYONE SIGN A RENTAL AGREEMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE RUN CREDIT, RENTAL AND CRIMINAL CHECKS ON THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED</strong>.

Use the Park Rules &amp; Regulations as a briefing tool.  The conversation should not be a ""laying down of the law"", but rather an open discussion of what is expected of both the new resident and community management.  New residents may not know their responsibilities (despite signing numerous documents outlining their rights/responsibilities), thus it is your responsibility to clarify and remind them of their responsibilities.  Be sure your new resident understands such things as:</p><ol><li>Rent is due on the first of each month:<ol><li>If rent is paid after the 5th day, the residents will be faced with a late fee.</li><li>If not paid by the 8th day, the resident will receive a 72-hour notice.</li><li>Residents must give 30 days written notice to vacate space or they intend to sell their manufactured home.</li></ol></li><li>Help your new resident be a good neighbor.

All other existing tenants shall receive a copy of the statement of policy upon expiration of their current rental agreement and before signing a new agreement.</p><p>While a Statement of Policy is not technically a contract, it is an important document.  A tenant or rental applicant who makes their decisions or changes their position in reliance upon the policies set forth in the statement may be entitled to hold the landlord to those written policies.  As proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy to tenants or applicants, it is advised to get a signed receipt.</p><p>A landlord who intentionally and deliberately fails to provide a Statement of Policy as required by ORS 90.510, or delivers a legally defective one, may be subject to a lawsuit.</p><p>The Statement of Policy is required to include the following information in summary form:</p><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;""><li>The location and approximate size of the space to be rented.</li><li>The federal fair housing age classification and present zoning that affect the use of the rented space.</li><li>The facility policy regarding rent adjustment and a rent history for the space to be rented.

Remember, you want to sell the prospective resident on your community, but you also want them to make a well informed decision.</p><p>Providing a prospective resident's with extensive information regarding your manufactured home community allows the applicant to evaluate for themselves if they qualify.

This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your ""Screening Criteria"" is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  That is up to you.  Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial  -  it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example  -  maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older  -  it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.</p><p>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations  -  write a ""screening criteria"" and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone  -  even if they are in a protected class  -  if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will ""self screen"" themselves by reading your ""screening criteria"" and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.</p><p>Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance.  This may include:</p><ul><li>Unsatisfactory rental references</li><li>Applicant must be 18 years or older</li><li>Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant's photo from a government office (i.e. Driver's License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card</li><li>Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.</li><li>If the community is either an ""age 55 or older"" or an ""age 62 or older"" Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements</li><li>The absence of any prior tenant history or credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory character references</li><li>Any criminal history</li><li>Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations</li><li>Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets</li><li>Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items</li><li>If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement</li><li>The number of additional occupants</li><li>Adverse information contained in the public record</li></ul><p>Additional criteria that may be added to qualify could include:</p><ul><li>Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords</li><li>No payment of rent problems over the past two years</li><li>Two years of verifiable employment</li><li>No criminal convictions</li><li>No tax liens</li><li>Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent</li><li>Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy</li><li>Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.</li><li>If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed.  Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs.  You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community</li><li>You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.</li><li>Homes must be owner occupied  -  no subleasing</li></ul><p>You MUST post your community's screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.</p><p><strong>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions!</strong> Once you make an exception for one of your criteria you are opening up the possibility of future problems.  You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations and do not make exceptions to your screening criteria.  Take the time to put your screening criteria in writing to protect yourself and provide prospective residents with a copy so that they can have the necessary information upon which to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Remember  -  you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or source of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone  -  even if they are in a protected class  -  if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.</strong></p><p>For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic.  However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.</p><p>Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law.

Exemptions for specific industries have been granted as late as the first week of December 2010.  MHCO and MHI are conducting research on this topic and will be providing additional information as it becomes available.  The Federal Trade Commission  link is http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/redflagsrule/index.shtml   and contains a lot of information that should be of interest to community owners and manufactured home community retailers.  If you are subject to the new rule there is a template developed by the FTC for businesses at low risk for identity theft at this site.  While we are still looking into this and monitoring developments in the Congress, it is likely that if a community owner is not billing for utilities, is not providing loans for residents purchasing homes, and is not acting as a retailer selling homes, they are not probably covered by the Red Flags Rule.</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule: What You Need to Know</h2><p>As of June 1, 2010 the Federal Trade Commission has begun enforcement of the 'Red Flags' rule which mandates creditors and financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs. It's important to spend some time discussing the rule, including what it is and what it means for you</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule - In Plain English</h2><p>The full title is this: ""Identity Theft Red Flags and Address Discrepancies under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003"" (FACT). It amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The rule was written specifically for companies making loans, such as banks and commercial lending institutions, but a portion of it extends to rental property owners and managers since both rely on consumer reports (e.g. credit) that (1) ask for sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and (2) could turn up address discrepancies. The philosophy behind this rule is simple: sensitive information must be kept secure to prevent identity theft, and a discrepancy in address could indicate fraud.</p><p>The rule requires that ""reasonable"" policies be in place to prevent identity theft and to verify a person's identity when an address discrepancy is reported. In the case of address discrepancy, if the property manager can't work out the discrepancy, the rule says he/she is not to rent to this individual.</p><h2>What the Red Flags Rule Means for Rental Owners &amp; Property Managers</h2><p>While the rule has caused some confusion, compliance is straightforward. More than likely, you're probably already in compliance since the only thing that rental owners or property managers have to show is that they have a ""reasonable"" process in place for preventing identity theft and for checking IDs, verifying IDs, and following up/asking about any discrepancies.</p><p>For example, how do you destroy electronic and paper records that contain sensitive information? Or how about this: if someone gives one address on his or her rental application, but the license lists another address, what's your policy for handling this situation? As long as you have reasonable policies in place, you're in compliance.</p><h2>Do I need to create a special report if I suspect fraud?</h2><p>The other commonly asked question about the Red Flags rule (beyond ""how do I comply"") is this: do we need to report suspected fraud? The answer - for better or worse - is no. If you believe someone is trying to perpetrate a fraud, there's no requirement beyond not renting to this individual.</p><h2>Still Unsure About the Red Flags Rule? Contact Your Screening Partner</h2><p>Laws, rules, and amendments result in legitimate questions and concerns, so we understand people's trepidation regarding the Red Flags rule. While it's true that you're likely already in compliance, it can't hurt to contact your screening partner and ask to review with them your policies and systems.</p><p>For full details, visit the FTC website at <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule</a></p><p>The information in this article should not be construed as legal advice.

It appears to be very unlikely, since the community managers see the defendants on a regular basis and have no knowledge of either of them serving in the United States Military. </em></p> <p>The problem you describe only occurs when the defendant does not appear at the first appearance hearing and the judge is uncomfortable granting the judgment of restitution by default without what he/she feels is sufficient evidence that they are not on active duty with the military.&nbsp; The rash of recent improper foreclosures against servicemen/women probably doesn't help the judge's comfort level.&nbsp; The judge should have been more helpful, but you should be able to conduct your search on the website, then go back and try again.</p> <p>I think the take-away here is that landlords should try to get as much information from their resident-applicants in order to avoid these situations in the future.</p>",839,1,1302219256,1402693705,1,0,0,0,086,13265,community_updates,und,MHCO DEFEATS:  Rent Control - Mandatory Mediation - Attorney General  Enforcement of Landlord-Tenant Law,"<p>The 2011 Oregon Legislative Session has now reached the halfway point.&nbsp; MHCO has been successful in defeating a number of particularly bad pieces of legislation.<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em> We need to stay engaged and vigiliant as the Legislative Session moves to adjournment in late June.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MHCO Defeated:<br></span></strong></p><p><strong>HB 2172</strong> - <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rent Control with mandatory mediation and the establishment of a regulatory enforcement regime that would all the Oregon Attorney General enforcement landlord- tenant law in Oregon manufactured home communities.</span></strong> &nbsp;For those of you who are familiar with Washington State this is a similar program with rent control. &nbsp;This bill had strong support from many legislators who are in powerful positions, including Representative Buckley who is the House Ways and Means Co-Chair. &nbsp;Peter Ferris was heavily involved in this bill - many of MHCO's members from southern Oregon have probably heard about his bill over the last year. &nbsp;Many of the concepts will resurface again in future Legislatures.</p><p><strong>HB 2885</strong> - This bill originally applied to all &nbsp;residential properties that had Department of Education employees who where evicted - required landlord to inventory their belongs and return appropriate property to the Department of Education. &nbsp;This bill has been amended to exclude residential property.</p><p><strong>HB 3073</strong> - This bill expanded upon HB 2383 from 2009 that established a 14 day right of first refusal. &nbsp;This bill was designed to increase the 14 days to an undetermined amount. &nbsp;I will have more about this issue in a subsequent update on the landlord tenant coalition bill. &nbsp;Representative Nathanson was hoping to increase the 14 days to a higher number.</p><p><strong>HB 3183</strong> - This bill lift the ban on local governments from passing rent control ordinances. &nbsp;It will still have a hearing later this session, but since it the public hearing did not occur before today the bill cannot move forward to a work session. &nbsp;It can only have a hearing - nothing more. &nbsp;That being said, please do not be complacent when a hearing is scheduled - we need as many people to show up to oppose this bill as possible. &nbsp;We will be dealing with this issue for the next session or two - we need to be vigilant.</p><p><strong>Two additional issues that MHCO has been focused</strong> - <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">mandatory water sub-meterin</span>g</strong> and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>mandatory escrow</strong></span> when a community owner sells a manufactured home in their community have been significantly altered.&nbsp; MHCO was able to perserve the exemption from mandatory water sub-metering for communities with 199 or less spaces.&nbsp; MHCO also successfully changed SB 85 to eliminate the mandatory escrow requirement for community owners who sell a manufactured home in their community.&nbsp; Two big wins for community owners in Oregon.</p>",839,1,1343766878,1511230134,1,0,0,0,093,13293,community_updates,und,New Americans with Disabilities Act Requirements for Swimming Pools,"<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I  have  been  informed  by  a  swimming  pool  company  that  manufactured  housing  community  owners  are  now  required  to  provide  an  accessible  means  of  entry  for  swimming  pools.    Is  it  true  that  community  owners  with  existing  pools  will  now  have  to  buy  pool  lifts  or  construct accessible stairs into the pool?  If so, it will be a huge expense for many park owners.</p> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The Americans with Disability Act, or ""ADA""deals with  accommodations in two major  sectors,  public  (Title  II)  and  private  (Title  III).    The  public  sector  covers  state  and  local  governmental  facilities  and  the  private  sector  deals  with  private  entities  that  ""own,  operate,  and  lease"" places  of  public  accommodation,  such  as  restaurants,  hotels,  theaters,  convention  centers,  retail  stores,  shopping  malls,  dry  cleaners,  laundromats,  pharmacies,  doctors'  offices,  hospitals,  museums,  libraries,  parks,  zoos,  amusement  parks,  private  schools,  day  care  centers,  health spa and bowling alleys.</p> <p>On  September  15,  2010,  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ),  who  enforces  the  ADA,  issued  revised  regulations  for  Titles  II  and  III.     Among  other  things,  the  new  regulations  include  new  accessibility  standards  for  swimming  pools.    Existing  swimming  pools  must  be  modified  to  comply  with  the 2010  guidelines  no  later  than March  12,  2012.   For  new construction,  the  2010  guidelines must be followed on a going forward basis.    Included  in  these  guidelines  are  swimming  pool  accessibility  requirements.  They  provide  that  any swimming pool with less than 300 linear feet of pool wall must provide one means of access  either  by  sloped  entry  or  by  the  installation  of  a  pool  lift.</p> <p>Any  pool  that  has  more  than  300  linear  feet  of  pool  wall  must  provide  two  means  of  access,  which  can  be  any  of  five  designated  means  of  access:    (1)  pool  lifts,  (2)  sloped  entries,  (3)  transfer  walls,  (4)  transfer  systems,  or  (5)  accessible pool stairs.    Having said this, it is clear that private manufactured housing communities are  neither public or  private  facilities that  offer  ""public accommodations""under the  ADA  "" at least  insofar  as they do  not open their pool and recreational facilities to the general public.</p> <p>However, two words of warning:</p><ol> <li>While  the  ADA  does  not  strictly  cover  private  residential  facilities  such  as  apartments,  homes  and  manufactured  housing  communities,  if  a  park  resident  provides  child  day  care  services  open  to  the  public  in  his  or  her  private  residence,  those  portions  of  the  residence  used  for  that  purpose  are  subject  to  ADA's  requirements.    So,  community  owners  and  managers  should  be  aware  if  any  of  their  residents  are  operating  such  services,  as  ADA  accessibility,  including  the  pool  area,  may  be  subject  to  ADA  requirements,  to  the  extent  that  the  resident  makes the park facilities available for use by the children.</li><li>The  Fair  Housing  Act,  which  is  administered  by  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (""HUD""),  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  handicap.    To  that  extent,  landlords  arerequired  to  make  ""reasonable  accommodations"" if  requested  by  their  handicapped  residents.   To  some extent, this could  apply  to  a pool or  other  recreational  facilities.   The  body of  law  as  to  what  constitutes  a  ""reasonable  accommodation"" is  far  too  voluminous to  address here.    Suffice  it  to  say,  however,  that  a  landlord  is  not  required  to  make  such  an  accommodation  (e.g.  retrofitting  the  community's  existing  swimming  pool)  if  the  cost  would  impose  an  undue  financial burden.</li> </ol> <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS Q &amp; A SERVICE THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED AS A BENEFIT FOR OUR MEMBERS.

About 60-70  MHCO members showed up supporting community owners  - the residents had about 10 people and could only muster five people to testify publicly in favor to the legislation.   Six people testified on MHCO's behalf with several more waiting in the wings if needed.  There were enough community owners to require an overflow hearing room.  Much of the resident testimony was directed at increasing taxes on their homes.  One Legislator suggested that the residents direct their complaints to the appropriate government taxing authorities and not community owners. Overall is was a good day for community owners - excellent testimony and information.   This was a good  opportunity to continue to educate Oregon Legislators.  MHCO's panel of six individuals representing a diverse section of the industry did an excellent job.MHCO confirmed at the end of the day that this legislation is dead and will not move beyond the public hearing.  We all know these issues do not go away - look for this issue and may other rent control schemes to come up again in the future.  Until the next full legislative session - 2013 - this issue is done.Thanks to those who testified on behalf of MHCO and those who were in attendance and where prepared to testify: Mike Wells, Gary Griglak, Richard Delaney, Kim Berry, Larry Engelgau, Dale Strom, Peter Schraner, Cory Poole, Robert Danielson and Troy Brost.Deep appreciation to those took the time to attend the hearing - your presence was noted.And a final note of thanks to all of you who sent e-mails.  Early yesterday morning I was talking to the chief of staff of one of the Legislators on  the committee and she commented that she was glad we finally reach the day of the rent control hearing - she was hoping it would be the end of all the rent control e-mails!  So thanks to all of you who made your presence known through e-mail.  Many thanks!We are now in the final stretch of the 2011 Legislative Session.

Here is a checklist of general issues you may wish to consider:</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Confidentiality always concerns me.</strong>&nbsp; Why does the company want it?&nbsp; I suspect they don't want parks ""comparing notes""on the deal they cut with their company.&nbsp; While that is understandable, it poses the risk of inadvertent disclosure.&nbsp; What is the ""penalty""for disclosure?&nbsp; Do you have to refund the initial payment made?&nbsp; If so, does that mean the deal is over, or does the remainder of the agreement survive  -  that is, does the company still have the exclusive right to provide services in the park?&nbsp; I think I would like to see some language which penalized only intentional or willful disclosures (assuming you have any ability at all to negotiate some of these terms).</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>I assume the company will own all of the equipment.</strong>&nbsp; Are there certain limitations on their ability to come and go inside the park?&nbsp; Specifically, is there a risk of noise, inconvenience, traffic issues, etc?&nbsp; How long will installation take?&nbsp; Will the park grounds be restored to their original condition?&nbsp; Again, remember, once these agreements are signed, you're at the company's mercy on what they do.&nbsp; Make sure their reputation for service and cooperation is good.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>What is the term of the agreement?</strong> I suspect it contains a provision for automatic renewal, absent one party or the other giving notice of termination?&nbsp; While that is fair, you have to carefully read the agreements to see if there is any right to terminate without cause.&nbsp; In other words, can you get out of the deal ""just because,""or does there have to be a breach?&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>If either side terminates does the initial payment have to be returned to the company?</strong>&nbsp; If so, you might consider making that payment ""nonrefundable""after a certain length of time, say five years.&nbsp; You want to make sure that if the agreements become unenforceable due to some law or similar situation over which you have no control, that you do not have to refund the money.&nbsp; That is why I suggest a period of years, after which the money becomes refundable.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Recording of any agreement is significant.</strong>&nbsp; Once recorded, it will act as a sort of restrictive covenant on the land, and will continue <em>ad infinitum.&nbsp; </em>In your case, I suspect that the recorded agreement will act as a sort of ""floating""easement, giving the company general rights of ingress and egress to install, maintain and repair the equipment.&nbsp; If the easement rights are not specifically defined, you may want to make sure you understand, in advance, where the equipment will be located.&nbsp; You want to make sure there will be no risk that the company's right of access interferes with the residents' spaces.&nbsp; It's easy to record such agreements on the public record, but much more difficult to remove them in the event of a dispute.&nbsp; Do either of your agreements address that issue?&nbsp; If you part ways with the company, are they obligated to remove their easement rights from the public record (e.g. by a recorded notice of abandonment of their rights under the agreement)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you have to pay any costs to have this done?</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li>You want to make sure that if the agreement is terminated the equipment must be removed promptly and the land returned to its general pre-installation condition.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>What about liability?</strong>&nbsp; It is not uncommon for these agreements to have cross indemnification provisions, whereby you agree to indemnify them for your negligence, and they do the same.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Are there limitations on damages in the agreement?</strong> &nbsp;Most companies attempt to place limits on the kinds of damages that may be recovered (e.g. prohibitions on punitive damages).&nbsp; Generally, that is fine, but just make sure that these limits apply just to park ownership, as you cannot limit the residents' right <em>vis a vis</em> the cable company.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>If the company has an exclusive right to market its services to the residents, you want to make sure you know what their marketing efforts will consist of.</strong>&nbsp; You want to make sure it will not include personal solicitation to residents.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Check with other parks to find out whether they have similar agreements.</strong>&nbsp; I acknowledge that they may not talk about it due to the confidentiality provisions, but suspect the agreement that may be recorded is not ""confidential. -""&nbsp; Your main concern should be whether other park owners are satisfied with this particular company.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Before jumping into anything, find out if there are competing companies that may have similar programs. </strong></li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>How will you deal with residents if they ask you whether you received any payment for giving the company its exclusive rights?</strong>&nbsp; The best response might be that your practice is not to discuss the park's financial arrangement with vendors.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you should expect someone might press the issue.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>How will the exclusivity provisions in the agreement affect a resident's right to have satellite service?</strong>&nbsp; Does the agreement deal with the possibility that satellite providers may want to market in the park?&nbsp; You may have some difficulty in preventing a resident from signing up for such service, so this issue should be addressed with the cable company ahead of time.&nbsp;

According to the  2007 period life table for the Social Security area population,  those on the cusp of retirement, ages 55 -""64, are expected to  live on average 21.34 more years.  Living in a manufactured  home community represents an ideal lifestyle choice for many  in this demographic.  The following represents some real  advantages that manufactured homes offer the 55+ market:    ""Manufactured homes can be customized to fit the  needs and wants of every homebuyer.  This includes  interior floor plans, exterior designs and custom  kitchens, baths and living areas.  ""Manufactured housing, especially those located in  land -""lease communities, are less expensive to  purchase and maintain.  ""Manufactured homes offer convenient one -""story  living and can be built for accessibility.  "" Manufactured home communities provide a unique  setting where smaller yards require less maintenance,  while individual home sites maximize privacy.   ""Manufactured home communities provide a secure,  friendly, relaxed environment with a strong sense of   - ˜community'.    How can manufactured housing communities benefit 55+?    Manufactured housing communities allow residents to own  their own home while leasing the land, thus eliminating the  expense of property taxes and allowing homeowners to enjoy  amenities and well -""maintained common areas.  According to  a report prepared for the Commission of Affordable Housing  and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century,  advantages of land -""lease properties are that ""the resident can  own the home with a lower down -""payment than virtually any  other housing alternative because the cost of land is not  included in the transaction. The resident can also benefit from  appreciation, provided the home is well maintained in a well""located and maintained park.""   In addition, and no less important, is the sense of community  engendered by the manufactured home lifestyle.   By  providing many opportunities for social interaction through  organized activities, such as clubs, fitness classes and social  events, communities encourage resident relationships.     Safety and security are top concerns for many residents.   Many 55+ communities are gated and provide on -""site security  as well as neighborhood watch programs.  By providing a  sense of security,  spaces to personalize, interesting  destinations and places to walk, and the options of having  pets, manufactured home communities have the potential of  encouraging active living for 55+ individuals.    What can community owners offer to attract the 55+ market?   Age restricted manufactured housing communities,  typically  called 55+, offer many advantages with many different types  of land -""lease communities to choose from.  They can be large  communities with numerous amenities or smaller and more  affordable family -""owned communities.  There are  communities located all over the country and in every price  range.  Common amenities include swimming pools,  clubhouses, health clubs, and tennis courts.    We know that most people begin their housing search online.   To capture the attention of those  looking online at housing  options, 55+ manufactured home communities need to have  attractive websites that provide lots of information, including  pictures of the community (not just individual homes),  information about lease fees, and testimonials from  homeowners.   In addition, an attractive and informative  website should highlight those services and amenities that are  important and attractive to seniors.  Jensen Communities  (www.jensencommunities.com), offers a great example of a  website that is user -""friendly. In addition to outlining  important information related to the advantages of living in a  manufactured home, the website provides prospective residents with a comprehensive list of special amenities found  in their communities.    Jim Ayotte, Executive Director of the  Florida Manufactured Housing Association, states,  ""to make  an emotional connection with prospective homebuyers, every  community's website should have a detailed description of  their value proposition, with quality pictures of homes and  individuals.  Homeowner testimonials are a great idea.""   With over 900 55+ manufactured home communities, Florida  represents a top destination choice for many.  In Mr. Ayotte's  view, the range of options available in Florida's 55+  communities is limitless.   Those in the 55+ market are  undoubtedly attracted to Florida's warm climate, sandy  beaches, suburban or rural settings (depending on  preferences), excellent health care and affordable cost of  living.  Many of Florida's 55+ manufactured housing  communities have swimming pools, community centers,  health clubs, tennis courts and executive or professional golf  courses.  Seniors are looking not just to buy a home but to buy  into a lifestyle.  Ayotte also explained that he expects the 55+  community industry to expand over the next ten years as the  baby -""boomer generation reaches  retirement age.  Experts  have indicated that baby -""boomers are very active and many  are expected to continue working after they retire.  Community owners that focus on the 55+ market need to be  poised to meet the unique needs of this large demographic.    Manufactured home communities continue to be a popular  option for a growing segment of the aging U.S. baby boomer  generation.  In the last decade, the median age of the nation  has increased from 35.3 to 37.2  -  an all -""time high as  determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.  In 2010, 17.3 percent  of Florida's population was age 65 or higher.  This trend is  expected to continue as more seniors flock to Florida and  other warm weather retirement destinations.  For seniors, 55+ manufactured home communities provide an affordable  housing choice with great lifestyle advantages.  Clearly, this  niche market is a great opportunity for seniors and  community owners alike.

The resident gave a 30-day notice earlier in the month.  Rent was paid to the 10th day of the following month. The resident left the home, taking his belongings, but claims he will be back to clean the home up and collect his $400 cleaning deposit.  However, the electric company is coming out to shut off the power because the resident owes them for unpaid bills.  The landlord is concerned about the pipes freezing, since the local temperatures at night drops into the low 20s.  What are the landlord's rights as far as entering the home?  Specifically, what can the landlord do to save the pipes?  Can the landlord have the electric bill changed to his/her name, enter the property and turn on the heat and power and then turn it off during the day?  Where is this covered in the Oregon Revised Statutes?  Can the landlord apply the $400 toward funds advance toward the electric bill?Answer:  Under this scenario, the landlord is also the owner of the home, so under certain circumstances, access would be permitted.  Under the manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law, where the tenant owns the home, I would say that the only right of access  -  even in an emergency  -  is to the space itself and not the interior of the home.  It would only be following the landlord's declaration of an abandonment under ORS 90.675, that he/she would have a right to enter the home itself.  Until that right arises, I would probably advise the landlord to stay out of the tenant's home under almost any circumstances, since there is no provision under the manufactured housing side of the law that permits such entry where the tenant owns the home.In our present case, the landlord also owns the home, so his/her rights are the same as any other landlord of an apartment or other rental unit.  A landlord's right of access where the landlord owns the home, would be found in ORS 90.322  90.322(1)(b) deals with emergency access:In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant's absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered. [Underscore added. - PCQ] As for the application of the security deposit, I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than simply applying it toward monies expended to keep the electricity on.  Your question called it a ""cleaning deposit."" If that is how it was designated, it suggests that it may be applied only toward cleaning of the home.  The better term to use in the rental agreement is ""security deposit""which is designed to ""secure the tenant's performance under the rental agreement."" If the rental agreement required that the tenant keep all such utility charges current, then the breach of that provision would entitle the landlord to apply the deposit toward the expenditure of funds to remedy the breach. The security deposit statute is ORS 90.300, and is helpful to read, as it addresses the landlord's duty to account to the tenant for the expenditure of funds within 31 days following termination of the tenancy, or the tenant's departure, if later than the termination.",839,1,1315848593,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0142,13335,community_updates,und,Medical Marijuana and Landlord Rights,"Question: Our community is seeing an increase in the use of ""medical""marijuana.  Although those using it say they have ""cards""permitting them to grow limited amounts, often this limited personal use appears to turn into more than that.  We are noticing increasing late night traffic at some users' homes, and believe they are expanding their grow operations in order to sell the marijuana to unauthorized users. What can be done about this?  It is quite disruptive to the rest of our community.Answer: A good discussion and summary of Oregon's medical marijuana law is found at the following link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/medicalmarijuanaprogram/Pages/index.aspx  The Oregon statutes are located at this link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/statutes.pdfHere are the Oregon administrative rules:http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/rules.pdf As you can no doubt see, these laws and rules are focused primarily on legal marijuana use, rather than illegal use.  Although Oregon's landlord-tenant law has a statute giving a landlord the right to issue a 24-hour notice to residents engaged in the manufacture, delivery or possession of controlled substances, it does not include ""The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475.300 to 475.346. -""In order to evict the offending resident(s), the difficulty is trying to prove that the resident is actually manufacturing, deliverying, or possessing marijuana in violation of the law.  This is particularly tough since the landlord cannot gain access to the interior of the home or the backyard. (If the backyard is concealed by a high fence, I would probably not advise a landlord to take pictures or view the area by using a ladder or other similar means.  Leave that for the police.All in all, I have three suggestions: (a) Go the police and see if you can enlist their help in stopping this activity; (b) Find out how to start a neighborhood watch program that will discourage persons driving in to buy drugs; (c) Carefully and patiently begin tracking neighbor complaints of late night activity that causes a disturbance to the other neighbors.  Begin by first contacting the offending resident by phone or a personal visit, politely asking that the activity cease.  If it continues, write a letter (not a termination notice).  If it continues, then issue a 30-day termination notice for violation of ORS 90.740(3)(i), which requires that tenants ""Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors."" Once this notice is given, if the conduct stops within the 30 days, you may re-issue a second notice with a 20-day non-curable termination if it re-occurs with 6 months following issuance of the first 30-day curable notice.  I prefer this approach, since the landlord is not required to ""prove""that the resident was actually engaging in the manufacture, delivery or possession of marijuana.  All you need to do is establish the circumstances giving rise to the disruption and that it is interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of the other residents.  The judge or jury will be able to ""connect the dots.""

Can she do that and if so, what kind of notice should she give?  Also, can she change the late fee from a flat amount to a percentage (e.g. 10%) of rent?Answer:  Here is a summary of ORS 90.260, the late fee statute.  It answers the questions posed above.(1)	 A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if: - ¢	The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and - ¢	There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:o	The tenant's obligation to pay a late charge;o	The type and amount of the late charge; ando	The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due.(2)	The amount of any late charge may not exceed: - ¢	A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. ""Reasonable amount""means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market; - ¢	A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the ""reasonable lat amount -"", described above; or - ¢	Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only.(3)	In periodic tenancies (e.g. month-to-month), a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days' written notice to the tenant.(4)	A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.(5)	A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.(6)	Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination.  [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge  on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]",839,1,1318260777,1402693692,1,0,0,0,0179,13365,community_updates,und,Landlord Requirements to have licensed plumber or electtrician,"Question:  A landlord recently purchased a manufactured home in his community.

It's one thing to be performing repairs on one's own home, and quite another to be doing so on a home intended for re-sale.

Management did not change the rules and regulations.  However, they did advertise the community as ""55&Older -""; identified that status in the community's Application Criteria; and have met the requirements of the ""80/20 Rule"".  Now the community owner is changing the rules. One of the many rule change includes altering the status of the community from ""Family"" to ""55 & Older"".  It is likely that the residents will have enough votes in the petition to vote down the rule changes.  Where does this leave the community's ""55 & Older Status""?  Does that status actually need to be in the rules?Answer: I believe the rule change is essential.  The reason is that it is the primary document (along with the rental agreement) that defines how the park is to operate under a 55+ regime.   Here is a brief summary of how these conversions should occur:Currently, in order to qualify for the 55+ exemption under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1989 (""FHAA -"") and the Housing for Older Persons Act (""HIPA -"") of 1999, a community must comply with the following requirements:1.	Be intended and operated for persons age 55 or over.  This intent can be met by such things as (1) The manner in which the community is described to prospective residents; (2) Advertising designed to attract prospective residents; (3) Lease or rental provisions; (4) The written rules and regulations; (5) Consistent application of the rules, regulations and procedures; (6) Actual practices; and (7) Publicly posting statements describing the facility as a 55+ community.   The age verification procedures must be updated every two years.  This means maintaining a complete file on each space, including with the tenant application updated information, circulated every two years, confirming the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home.2.	 Have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical.   Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that the 20% margin must be reserved for families with children?  The answer is ""No."" In fact, a 55+ community may strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age or older?  Again, the answer is ""No."" If desired, the community may increase the age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.   Similarly, the community may impose a more restrictive minimum age requirement than 55.  However, it is important for park owners and managers to make sure that all such age/occupancy requirements be properly reflected in the community's Rules and the Statement of Policy  -  and be consistently applied.   3.	Publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be operated as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory.  The community must make sure that in all that it does, from its advertising, rules, rental agreements, and all other policies, it always hold itself out as a 55+ facility.   4.	Comply with HUD age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that 80% of the facility be intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver's license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.  Today, if the community can meet the HOPA requirements in all respects (not because it discriminated in getting there, but simply by attrition of family occupants and the influx of more 55+ residents), it should be permitted to do so.  The process would be fairly simple for those communities that exceed the minimum 80% floor (i.e. at least one occupant age 55 or over):  Implement a rules change to conform with the 55+ laws, combined with new published policies and age verification procedures, which confirm the community's 55+ status.  One caveat:  Even though the Oregon landlord-tenant law does permit rules changes to implement material modifications in the parties' bargain, there is a risk of possible argument by families in the community, complaining that they are now limited in the pool of available buyers for their homes.  However, this risk can be remedied by ""grandfathering""those family residents in, thereby permitting them to sell their homes to other families.  This assumes, of course, that by doing so, the community would not jeopardize its 80%-20% ratio.  Before proceeding down this path, park owners are urged to contact their own legal counsel familiar with the FFHA and HOPA for advice and direction.",839,1,1321894387,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0205,13391,community_updates,und,Resident Pays After FED Issued Settles Before Hearing,"<p>Question:  We have had to file two consecutive FED Complaints against a resident.  The day before the first appearance for each case, the resident tender the rent that was due, although he do not pay the court fees of $115.00.  After two months of this, he owes us $230.00.  He promises to repay this amount but does not.  Now rent is due for January, 2012.  We are sure the same thing will happen again. How can we collect the court fees?</p><p>Answer:  I assume that when he tenders the rent, you accept it and report to the court that the case is to be dismissed.  This means that any leverage you had to make the full payment, including court fees, has disappeared.  You might consider one of the two following alternatives:</p><p>1.	Since the 72 hours has already expired and you've had to file the FED complaint, you are not required to accept the rent unless he agrees to pay the court fees.  Next time, if he declines, don't let the case be dismissed.  Go to the regularly scheduled first appearance.  If he shows up, tell the judge you'd gladly permit him to stay if he pays the filing fees.  If he can't afford to pay it in one lump sum, negotiate a repayment plan (e.g. 50% next month and 50% the following month).  Then have the judge put the agreement in a Stipulated Judgment of Restitution, which means that if he doesn't pay the sums do as scheduled, you can go back to court to have him evicted.</p><p>2.	Under Oregon's ""three strikes""law [ORS 90.630(8)-(10)], if a resident is issued three 72-hour notices within a rolling 12 month period, you can issue them a 30-day non-curable eviction notice, on or shortly after, the third strike.  Then you can say to the resident that you will permit them to stay only on condition of payment of the outstanding court fees.  Obviously, this is a pretty big hammer and if they can't pay the fees all at once, you should negotiate partial payments, similar to what I suggested above.  However, this alternative would automatically not result in a ""Stipulated Judgment of Restitution""(you would have to be in court to get that).  For that reason, I prefer No. 1 over No. 2.</p>",839,1,1325630896,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0207,13393,community_updates,und,Abandonment and Resident Destruction of Home,"<p><strong>Question: </strong> A resident living alone passed away.  It took some time for the estate to get underway because they had to search for heirs.  An heir was located and was appointed as Administrator to act on behalf of the estate.    Shortly after the resident's passing, we began requesting that a Storage Agreement be signed but the estate was hesitant to do so until the Administrator was appointed.  After the appointment the Administrator was initially cooperative, but unexpectedly changed his mind and is now threatening to bring all of the past due rent current, and then, out of spite, tear the home down while still on the space.  Presumably, after doing so, we would expect the Administrator to cease all further space rental payments.  How should we handle this?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong> This sounds like an episode from a Jerry Springer reality show!  Your question doesn't make it clear whether the estate was formally filed for probate in court, in which case this ""Administrator""would be subject to court supervision and would have to have a bond.  I'm suspecting that is not the case  -  but if it is, you may want to secure legal counsel to notify the court of what's happening and perhaps get him removed.</p><p>Assuming that the person is just a designee for the un-probated estate (I will call him the ""representative -""), I would suggest that you look to ORS 90.675(20), which applies when a resident living alone passes away.  Subsection (20) is summarized below, but should not be used as a substitute for reading ORS 90.675 (linked here) in its entirety:</p><p> - ¢	This subsection (20) applies the same duties as those of a resident who abandoned the property.</p><p> - ¢	It also applies to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court, or any person designated in writing by the decedent to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death;</p><p> - ¢	The 45-day abandonment notice required in ORS 90.675(3) (go to above link) is to be sent by first class mail to this representative at the premises, and also personally delivered or sent by first class mail to them if actually known to the landlord.</p><p> - ¢	If the representative responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided in the letter and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later.</p><p> - ¢	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Entering into the storage agreement includes the duty to pay a ""storage fee""which can be no higher than the space rent. This duty is not triggered until the 45-day letter is sent.  Presumably you will use a good storage agreement that requires, among other things, compliance with all applicable park rules and state, federal and local laws and ordinances, including a duty to maintain the space.  On- site destruction of the home is NOT maintaining the space.  Depending upon the home's age, on site destruction could be a violation of certain environmental laws, due to potentially hazardous material used in construction.  In fact, since there is a risk that the representative will not comply with the storage agreement  -  based on his threat of destruction - you may want to consider  -  only upon the advice of your attorney  -  to restrict his unsupervised access to the home.  Destruction of the home would not only take it off the tax rolls in violation of Oregon property tax law, but it would prevent you, as the landlord, from selling the home upon failure of the representative to meet his obligations.  Remember, in addition to the tax collector, you have a vested interest in seeing the home sold for recoupment any sums due (arguably including attorney fees) incurred during the abandonment process.</em></p><p> - ¢	Since the abandonment law requires that the landlord has a duty of safe keeping pending completion of the abandonment process, it is my belief  that this entitles the landlord to secure the home (e.g. with a new lock) so that heirs and others cannot enter and remove personal property.</p><p> - ¢	A storage agreement entitles the representative to store the personal property on the space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</p><p> - ¢	If such an agreement is entered into, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder (if any) until the agreement with the representative ends.</p><p> - ¢	If the representative requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement and there is a lienholder, also, you should review subsections (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of ORS 90.675, which describes the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</p><p> - ¢	During the term of the Storage Agreement, the representative has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir who wishes to leave the property on the space and become a tenant.  However, this prospective tenant is subject to the same statutory requirement, including landlord qualification and approval, as found in ORS 90.680 (linked here).

The following are just some of the factors:</p><p>- Type of Park:<br />Are you family friendly, 55 &amp; older, Seasonal, or possibly a combination?</p><p>- Management:<br />Is your park managed by a management company? Do you have an onsite manager? Does the owner visit the park often?</p><p>- Rental Units:<br />Does your park have rental units? Do you require renters to carry renters insurance? Are the rental units inspected inside and out at least annually?</p><p>- Utilities:<br />Is your park on city sewer and water? If on a well, how often is the water tested? Is it tested by an outside independent company? How often is trash disposed of?</p><p>- Recreational Facilities:<br />Playground? Horseshoe pits? Tennis courts? Basketball courts? Weight room or exercise equipment?</p><p>- Exposure to water:<br />Do you have a pool? Does it have a slide or diving board? Is the pool area completely fenced? Are the rules and regulations clearly posted? Are depths marked? Is there safety equipment available? Is there a Jacuzzi or hot tub?</p><p>Is there any other exposure to water? (lake, pond, river, etc.)</p><p>- Security<br />Is there a gate at the entrance to your park? Are there security patrols from an outside agency? Are any park activities open to the public?</p><p>- Streets:<br />Are the streets paved? Are there any pot holes, depressions, or major cracks? Do you have speed humps? Are they painted? Is a speed limit posted? Do you have street lights?</p><p>- Tree exposure:<br />Does your park have an exposure to large trees? Are they pruned regularly?</p><p>Finally, the two most important factors Insurance companies consider when insuring a Mobile Home Park...</p><p>How many spaces?<br />Gross annual revenue?</p><p>Feel free to contact me if anything you have read in this article creates a question for you.</p><p>Todd Montgomery<br />511 Center Street<br />Oregon City, OR 97045<br />(503) 768 - 9706<br /><a href=""mailto:todd@simmons-ins.com"">todd@simmons-ins.com</a><br /><a href=""http://www.simmons-ins.com"" title=""www.simmons-ins.com"">www.simmons-ins.com</a></p>",839,0,1404920824,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012806,15906,community_updates,und,Advertising and Fair Housing Violations,"<p>By: Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council of Oregon</p><p>In 1994 the following article by Rob Selleck, RE/MAX Times Associate Editor, was published by the National Fair Housing Advocate Online (<a href=""http://www.fairhousing.com/index.cfm?method=page.display&amp;pagename=March-April_1994_Page5"" title=""http://www.fairhousing.com/index.cfm?method=page.display&amp;pagename=March-April_1994_Page5"">http://www.fairhousing.com/index.cfm?method=page.display&amp;pagename=March-...</a>).</p><p>How many potential violations of the U.S. Fair Housing Act can you spot in this advertisement?</p><p>""Two bedroom executive home in exclusive neighborhood. Walking distance to country club. Active adult living at its finest. Perfect environment for empty nesters looking for quiet, private neighborhood.""</p><p>If you missed any of the eight potential pitfalls, you're exposing yourself and your office to some costly penalties - or at least to some legal hassles that can easily be avoided.</p><p>Why take the risk?<br />The National Association of Realtors® and groups such as the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association have created comprehensive publications that guide real estate agents and brokerages through the requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act in general - and its advertising impacts in particular.</p><p>The Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, sex, handicap, familial status and national origin. Some state and local provisions cover marital status and other classifications as well.</p><p>The manual produced by the Oregon Newspapers group states, ""Charges of discrimination are more likely now, whether or not they will be proven ultimately before a judge. ...There are `fair housing councils' active in many localities that are pursuing creators and publishers of alleged illegal advertising. It is to everyone's benefit, especially to the benefit of the advertisers and readers of newspapers and the consumers of residential housing, if we are scrupulous about learning the provisions of the law.""</p><p>The Oregon newspapers group created the manual in response to a battery of fair housing violation charges levied against 13 Oregon newspapers in late 1991 by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon.</p><p>The fact that newspapers are included in the liability loop doesn't mean real estate agents and brokerages placing advertisements are excluded. Indeed, real estate agents are under even closer scrutiny. Additionally, as the Oregon manual notes, the discrimination doesn't have to be intentional. Ignorance of the law's particulars is no excuse.</p><p>And while fairness and common sense go far in assuring compliance with the Act, it takes closer study to truly understand the laws' scope and consequences as the example ad at the opening of this article demonstrates.</p><p>The most effective general guideline emphasized by both NAR and the Oregon Newspapers group is succinctly stated in the Oregon manual: ""The English language is rich and so are writers' imaginations. We can write enticingly and persuasively about the property. Just avoid referring to the kinds of people who might live in a particular dwelling, because that is where discrimination sneaks in.""</p><p>In other words, mention number of bedrooms not number of people; in a rental ad specify ""no drinking"" and ""no smoking,"" not non-drinkers and non-smokers. Even a phrase as seemingly innocuous as ""handyman's dream"" should raise a caution flag. In the wrong context it could be construed as indicating preference for a single male. The solution? Stick to ""fixer-upper.""</p><p>Emphasize amenities, not potential participants: tennis courts, not tennis players; paths, not bicyclists.</p><p>Emphasizing a property's proximity to certain landmarks also creates some potential problems. A home billed as near a ""church,"" or ""synagogue,"" or ""temple,"" could be interpreted as an attempt to steer a certain religious group to or away from the area. Even some neighborhood names in certain cities have taken on a type of code status that suggests poverty, affluence, ethnic background or national origin.</p><p>The Oregon manual suggests sticking with geographical-type locations such as northwest, southeast, or street names.</p><p>While the tone of this article is, perhaps, a tad bitter, I have to agree with much of what it has to say. The FHCO and other fair housing organizations across the country have, in fact, as part of our missions helped enforce fair housing laws including the Federal Fair Housing Act's (FHA) provision that it is illegal to publish, or cause to be published, any illegally discriminatory statement. It is true, as well, that intent is not the barometer used to determine if any portion of the FHA has been violated. In fact, HUD has very recently provided clarity on the matter, codifying a long-used legal precedent that FHA prohibits practices that result in illegal discrimination regardless of whether there was intent to discriminate.""""</p>""",839,0,1406916044,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012880,15980,community_updates,und,Summer 2014 Legislative Update,"<p>Last month the manufactured housing landlord-tenant coalition met to continue discussing issues in preparation for the 2015 Oregon Legislative session. As mentioned earlier, the coalition is a group of manufactured housing community interests - tenant organizations, landlord associations, banking interests, builders - that meet once a month to discuss industry issues. Manufactured Housing Communities of Oregon has been participating in the coalition since the 1990s.</p><h2>It's the Dog Days of Summer - As 2015 Legislative Issues Get Legs</h2><p>There are four issues that the coalition is discussing: 1. Back taxes owed on abandoned MHs (ORS 90.675 (14) 2. Who collects the $6 assessment on manufactured homes to fund the Manufactured Communities Resource Center (MCRC) 3. Revising ORS 90.630 regarding the cure period for ongoing versus discrete violations 4. Manufactured home sales conflicts with owner sales versus tenant sales</p><h3>1. Back taxes owed on abandoned MHs (ORS 90.675 (14)</h3><p>The negotiations on this statute focus on the situation where the current market value of the abandoned home is more than $8,000 and the proceeds of the sale don't cover the landlord costs and the past due taxes that have accumulated. In these cases, the financial incentive for the landlord when there is no purchaser at the abandonment sale is to destroy the home. Most community owners are not willing to pay $12,000 in taxes for a $9,000 home.</p><p>MHCO's position is to reduce this tax burden on the community owner as much as possible either by completely eliminating the tax obligation or reducing it as far as possible. The county tax assessors proposed eliminating up to $8,000 of the tax liability. MHCO's position is that the amount waived needs to be higher so that the economics of keeping abandoned homes in the community pencils out. We will be back in August negotiating this issue further, but it remains MHCO's top legislative issue.</p><h3>2. Who collects the $6 assessment on manufactured homes to fund the Manufactured Communities Resource Center (MCRC)</h3><p>Currently, ORS 446.525 imposes an annual $6 assessment on all manufactured homes which are taxed as personal property, meaning that they are not real estate (on land with joint ownership of the MH and the land or in a co-op or with a 20 year lease). The county assessor is responsible for collecting the assessment and forwarding the revenue to OHCS for MCRC. The concept is to collect this special assessment with the annual property taxes owed. This applies regardless of whether the MH is in a park.</p><p>MCRC estimates that the special assessment plus the $25 registration fee for all parks generated $443,051 in FY 2013 and $422,627 in FY 2014.</p><p>There are an estimated 63,000 MHs in parks; at $6 apiece, that would be $378,000/year. But the assessment is paid by non-park MHs, too.</p><p>In the past couple of years Multnomah County and some other counties have expressed a desire to get out of the business of collecting the $6 assessment. Multnomah County is drafting a bill for the 2015 Legislative Session exempting it from having to collect the $6 assessment</p><p>County tax collectors feel that, as a matter of principle, they should only collect taxes for their costs and for other local governments. This is not a tax.</p><p>Some manufactured home residents don't pay property taxes, either because of the senior tax deferral program or because of the ORS 308.250 cancellation of taxes on low-value (currently $15,500) MHs. That means the county bills those residents only for the $6. And, with the early payment 3 percent discount, the actual amount owed is only $5.82. The counties' cost to collect this amount exceeds the amount collected.</p><p>The coalition discussed increasing the assessment to $10 per manufactured home and possibly use some of the extra money to compensate the counties or MCRC to cover the cost to collect. Another proposal would expand this fee to floating homes. MHCO's position is to avoid having the community owner collecting the assessed fee from the residents and then passing the accumulated fees on to the Oregon Department of Revenue. The issue remains open to further negotiation.</p><h3>3. Revising ORS 90.630 regarding the cure period for ongoing versus discrete violations</h3><p>Manufactured home community residents who own and occupy their MHs and rent the space under the home in a community can only have their tenancies terminated for cause. Those causes are defined, to some degree, in ORS 90.630. The statute allows the tenant to cure the cause, within the 30 day notice period, and thereby avoid the termination. In some cases, the result of this cure right means that a tenant may continue the conduct which is the cause up until the 30th day.</p><p>Over the years, many of you have contacted the MHCO office to discuss 30 day notices of eviction and in the process expressed frustration that residents who where disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of other residents or where violating the rules and regulations in the community could continue living in the community till the end of the 30 day period after the notice had been served. As many of you have said to me on the phone, So basically they can misbehave for 30 days and we can't do a thing....""</p><p>We continue to discuss what conduct should be stopped immediately and what conduct should be allowed the full 30 days to cure. Phil Querin has suggested using the distinction that anything that materially impacts other residents should require a shorter period to cure. Some feel this is too subjective - where do you draw the line: failure to mow grass; large campaign sign for Kitzhaber; loud music; foul odors coming out of a home etc.</p><p>We will continue to discuss this issue in the months ahead. MHCO recognizes this is an important issue to both community owners/managers and residents. It remains one of our top legislative priorities.</p><h3>4. Manufactured home sales conflicts with owner sales versus tenant sales</h3><p>There have been some alleged abuses in situations where residents are trying to sell their homes and the community owner has other homes in the community that he/she are selling. Some residents claim that this inherent conflict results in their homes either not selling or selling at a substantially reduced price.</p><p>The State of Oregon has been investigating this through the Department of Consumer and Business Services. It is not clear what action the State wants to take - or other legislators for that matter. One of the proposals considered by the state is to prohibit issuance of any type of Manufactured Structure Dealer license to any mobile home or manufactured dwelling park owner or onsite park management representative. Other less draconian measures would be to adopt a ""best practices"".</p><p>Needless to say this is an issue that MHCO that will be watched closely. MHCO opposes eliminating your ability sell homes in your community. This may be an issue we will have to fight in the 2015 Oregon Legislative Session.</p>""",839,1,1407716194,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012888,15988,community_updates,und,Sensible Innovation for Financing Homes in the Dodd-Frank Era,"<p align=""center""><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">By &nbsp;Anthony Ducharme,&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Direct Channel Manager, Mountainside Financial, a division of San Antonio Credit Union.&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://mountainsidefinancial.com/"" style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">mountainsidefinancial.com</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">.&nbsp;</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em><u><strong>Editor's Note:</strong></u></em> &nbsp;MHCO is excited to host Anthony Ducharme as one of many speakers at the 2014 MHCO Annual Conference. &nbsp;If you are looking for the latest on how to finance homes in your community - in addition to how to access the ""carve out"" that MHCO negotiated in the last Oregon Legislative Session will you not want to miss this seminar! &nbsp;Sign up today!</div><p align=""center"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center""><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The Direct Team has always been a consumer-focused service platform.

The back taxes owed on some abandoned MHs may be significant, even exceeding the value of the manufactured home. In these cases, the financial incentive for the landlord, assuming there is no purchaser at the required abandoned property sale, is to destroy or give away the manufactured home. This creates a vacant space in the park.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MHCO would like to see all taxes on an abandoned manufactured home waived.&nbsp; The tax assessor association proposed waiving the first $8,000 of taxes owed to be waived if the landlord buys the home.&nbsp; At this time the MHCO is considering options to raise that amount or to completely waive the taxes owed.&nbsp; Again, no final decision has been made and negotiations continue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cure Period for Discrete vs. Ongoing Violations.&nbsp; </strong>As we have mentioned in earlier legislative updates, MHCO would like to see the 30-day cure"" (ORS 90.630) period reviewed with some changes.&nbsp; Allowing a resident to continue disruptive behavior for 29 days and then correct the behavior just before the 30 day ""cure"" period ends does not seem fair to the other residents in the community and management.&nbsp; We continue to discuss options.&nbsp; MHCO has proposed &nbsp;that anything that impacts the resident's ""peaceful enjoyment"" should require a shorter ""cure"" period.&nbsp; Again - no final decision was made and we will continue to discuss this at the next coalition meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Manufactured Home Sales - Conflict Community Owner Sales vs. Resident Sales.&nbsp; </strong>The Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) has been investigating conflicts between community owner sales of homes and resident sales.&nbsp; DCBS has met with the coalition on several occasions but no specific proposal has been put on the table.&nbsp; This is the issue that MHCO is most concerned about as we head into the 2015 Legislative session.&nbsp; There will be a more in depth discussion on this issue at the next meeting.&nbsp; MHCO will keep you posted as this issue develops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fixes to Resident Purchase.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;There are several issues that have been discovered regarding the resident purchase program (HB 4038) that was passed in the 2014 February session.&nbsp; Below is a brief summary of the issue and the proposed solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A. The loophole is in favor of tenants",23,1,1411069956,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012901,16001,community_updates,und,Understanding Elder Abuse by April Quast and Ashley Carroll,"<p>Elder Abuse in our society is hidden.&nbsp; For every one case that is reported, 24 cases go unreported (National Clearinghouse on Abuse in Late Life).&nbsp; There are several factors that contribute to this.&nbsp; An older adult is reluctant to admit that abuse is happening.&nbsp; Guilt and shame are silencers in Elder Abuse.&nbsp; Some folks do not have the capacity to report that abuse is happening.&nbsp; This could be a capacity issue but also is impacted by Generational Culture.&nbsp; Does the older adult know that rape in a marriage is rape? Rape in a marriage was legal until 1976. &nbsp;Is the older adult comfortable talking about his or her body? Another reason cases go unreported is because no one inquires how an older person is doing with changes in their lives.&nbsp; For example, when an adult child moves back in with the older person the assumption is it's a positive change.&nbsp; Does the older person get asked about the change in his or her living situation? Elder abuse can also be physically hidden. &nbsp;When an older adult is hurt it can go unnoticed because of the belief that bruises and falls are part of the aging process.</span></p><p>While we know that anyone in a trusting relationship with the older person has the potential to be abusive, the dynamic is still predominantly intimate partner violence.&nbsp; This can be a long term relationship that has had abuse occurring all throughout the history of the relationship.&nbsp; Another form is a new relationship, possible post-divorce or widowed.&nbsp; In this relationship an older person may have experienced abuse in the past or this may be his or her first experience with abuse.&nbsp; Late Onset is a description of a relationship that has changed with an organic condition.&nbsp; The abusive person could have been controlling and verbally abusive and now is physically abusive.&nbsp; Or abuse may have not been present in the history of the relationship and now is, due to an organic condition such as dementia or capacity changes.&nbsp; Another dynamic is a person who was abused in the past and is now abusing the abuser.&nbsp; Believing, safety planning and collaboration are key in supporting the older survivor.</p><p>Take action by not letting the older folks in your lives be invisible.&nbsp; Try to notice when your older neighbor isn't around or big changes occur in his or her lives.&nbsp; An adult child moving in, mobility changing, caregivers that aren't consistent or anyone that appears to be controlling the older person's life.&nbsp; Are the same support folks coming around or has something changed? Try to give that older adult some private space to have a safe conversation.&nbsp; Often, if the abuser thinks the older adult might be asking for help or telling others about the controlling behaviors, the abuser will retaliate.&nbsp; This could be punishing, physically and emotionally abusing or further isolation. Connecting with your local Adult Protective Services agency, Domestic Violence Agency and Social Service Senior agencies are a key way to help the older adult.&nbsp; The collaboration of these agencies can provide protection and support by the way of Elderly/Disabled Persons Abuse Prevention Act, criminal charges, emotional and resource support.</p>",23,0,1412959699,1414434653,1,0,0,0,012926,16026,community_updates,und,Legislative Update:  MHCO Wins Major Concession on Abandoned Home Back Taxes,"<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Last week MHCO met with representatives of the Oregon county tax assessors and successfully negotiated the elimination of abandoned home back taxes.</span></p><p>For those you who have been following this issue - earlier this year MHCO set out to make significant changes to ORS 90.675 that requires community owners to pay the back taxes owed on an abandoned home if they want to purchase the home and keep it in their community.&nbsp; After a lengthy series of meetings with MHCO, the counties agreed to cancel unpaid back taxes on abandoned manufactured homes.</p><p>There remain technical issues, but the main hurdle - eliminating the tax obligation - has been resolved.&nbsp; Here are the details of the agreement -</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>No cap on the amount of back taxes to be cancelled.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>The landlord will need to file an affidavit/form (MHCO will work with the county tax assessors on the form which ultimately will be posted on MHCO.ORG).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>The affidavit/form will state:</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>That the landlord has sold or will sell the MH to an unrelated buyer;</li>	<li>The buyer will live in the MH in the park;</li>	<li>The sale is an arms-length transaction;</li>	<li>The amount of the sale price, along with the total of the landlord's claims or costs against the manufactured home, limited to unpaid back rent, sale costs (per ORS 90.675 (13) (a) consists of the reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage for a reasonable period, and sale; presumably this includes attorney fees, but only to do these tasks), and any improvements done by the landlord to the manufactured home as part of the sale.</li>	<li>The landlord may deduct from any sale proceeds the cost of storage (typically space rent) only for a reasonable period, as necessary to complete the abandonment process, to make any repairs necessary to make the manufactured home saleable, and to sell it.</li>	<li>The landlord will pay any county warrant fees required for the cancellation</li>	<li>The landlord will pay any amount from the sale in excess of the landlord's costs (unpaid rent, sale costs, improvement, etc.) to the&nbsp;county for unpaid taxes. &nbsp;The landlord will be allowed to keep any excess over the unpaid back tax amount.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Later this month there will be further discussions on the details regarding the affidavit and other potential legislative issues.&nbsp; As with all previous landlord-tenant coalition bills the participants in the negotiations reserve the right not to make a final commitment until the final draft is on the table.&nbsp; Depending on what is or is not in that final agreement will determine MHCO's final position.&nbsp; A lot can happen between now and the final draft of a bill - but today we are very happy that we have made significant progress in changing a very onerous statute that impacts every community owner who ends up wanting to buy an abandoned home in their community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to everyone from MHCO who worked on these negotiations.&nbsp;

The odds are that there will either be a compromise bill (typically know as the coalition bill) or we could face some nasty political battles on some onerous legislation.&nbsp; The coalition provides a venue for both landlords and tenants to work through selected issues.&nbsp;

However, as familiar as we are with conflict, many might conclude the value of time invested in conflict pales in comparison to the value of the fistful of other urgent park duties and priorities. This short article is to remind park managers and owners of an inexpensive tool to help resolve conflict, build relationships and save everyone involved time and money.&nbsp; Of course I'm speaking of mediation, but before going further, allow me to assure you I am not coming from a hypothetical, altruistic, touchy feely""",23,1,1438790604,1511230134,1,0,0,0,013058,16158,community_updates,und,Financing Your Community,"<p><strong>Financing Your Community &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>By: &nbsp;J.&nbsp;DiMarco&nbsp;and Gerard D.&nbsp;DiMarco</strong></p><p>Almost every community owner at some point in time will experience the need for financing of some kind. There have been many ups, downs, and complexities of the financial markets over the past 25 years, and the impact these fluctuations have had on available loans has been huge. In this article we will address some of the important issues that community owners may face during the lending process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lenders are back after the credit crunch of a few years ago</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since the financial crisis that began around 2007, the capital markets began to slowly re-emerge in late 2010 and early 201 for manufactured home community lending on a wide scale. Today's lending market, combined with historically low interest rates, is the strongest it has been in years. Lenders are eager to provide long term fixed rate, non-recourse loans with 30 year amortizations on manufactured home communities. We are currently helping a customer refinance a five year commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) loan that closed in March 2010 (our records indicate it was one of the nation's first&nbsp;CMBS&nbsp;loan post financial crisis) with a ten year fixed rate loan at less than 4.25%. The existing loan the borrower is paying off had a rate of 6.5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few other real world examples include recently helping a client lock a ten year fixed rate loan at 3.51%! Additionally, another client just secured a 4.2% long term fixed rate, replacing a rate of 6.5% from the previous note. The market has improved dramatically!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are currently numerous lending platforms and options available for community owners including conduit lenders (CMBS), life insurance companies, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, credit unions, and traditional bank loans. There are also a wide range of product options and features available in today's financial market including bridge lending, short term floating rate debt, interest only, mezzanine debt, and flexible prepayment options. With so many options available, finding loan that suits your specific needs as a manufactured community owner is possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to obtain a mortgage</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two major components that lenders review when analyzing a loan request; the guarantor, and the property itself.

There are many facets of marketing for whatever business you try to promote.&nbsp; It depends on the type of market you are in, the general state of the economy at the time you decide to start a promotion and marketing program, whether you are creating a demand or meeting a need, and several other variables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who are your Partners in Marketing?</strong></p><p>Media Sources</p><div><ul>	<li value=""8"">Motif</li>	<li value=""8"">Residents</li>	<li value=""8"">Employees</li>	<li value=""8"">Retailers</li>	<li value=""8"">Curb Appeal</li>	<li value=""8"">Vendors</li>	<li>Personal Development</li>	<li value=""8"">Professionalism</li>	<li value=""8"">Industry Knowledge</li>	<li value=""8"">Civic Involvement</li></ul></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><span style=""font-size:12px;"">The Mental Picture of Marketing</span></strong></h3><p>Every minute of every day in every dealing you have with each person, you are promoting yourself, the company you represent, your community, and the industry as a whole.&nbsp; Picture a diagram that consists of a huge wheel.&nbsp; There is a hub in the very center. It is a small circle.&nbsp; You are this hub.&nbsp; Radiating outward from this hub are eleven spokes that then connect with a huge wheel on the outside.&nbsp; Each of the eleven spokes is one of the areas of promotion we are going to discuss in this handbook.&nbsp; The huge wheel on the outside is your market: the general public, the planning and zoning officials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, this huge wheel is a never-ending stream of potential customers.&nbsp; This huge wheel also makes up the members of the general public at large.&nbsp; Everyone has an opinion.&nbsp; On this huge wheel, everyone has an opinion about manufactured housing and manufactured home communities.&nbsp; Part of a successful promotion and marketing program is to create more and more favorable opinions of the general public that is part of that huge wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the one of the eleven spokes joins the wheel, a direct line of vision, understanding and agreement is created between the hub (you) and the wheel (your market).&nbsp; Both ends of the spoke (you in the hub and the general public on the wheel) then see things the same way.&nbsp; The conduit that enables this ""coming together"" of opinion is the spoke that links you in your hub with your potential customer on the huge wheel.&nbsp; When this happens, you have successfully created a promotion (being noticed) that may result in effective marketing (a sale or lease).&nbsp;&nbsp; The other positive side effect is usually the creation of a more favorable image of the manufactured housing industry as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the public that is represented by the wheel is comprised of elected officials, your promotional efforts may result in positive zoning decisions or approval of expansion plans for a new community.&nbsp; When that public represents your customer, you will have created a sale of a home or a lease of a homesite.&nbsp; We need all kinds of people from this public arena on our side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This illustration gives you a visual image of the way a successful promotion can take you where you have never been before  -  or leave you spinning around in circles.&nbsp; You are in the center ring.&nbsp; Take charge of your promotional efforts.&nbsp; Create new markets.&nbsp; Realize new growth opportunities.&nbsp; Change the image of manufactured housing.&nbsp; It all starts with you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A successful promotion and marketing program will affect your staff, your community, your residents, their friends, their co-workers and families, the surrounding business community, and the industry as a whole in a positive way.&nbsp; It will help change the perception of manufactured housing in the eyes of the uneducated public, the elected officials, and increase the number of homeowners.&nbsp; Your successful promotion and marketing program will generate a continued bottom-line growth for your community and your company while providing housing that is perceived as a <u>true value</u> by your customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And, by the same token, an unsuccessful promotion and marketing program  -  or the total lack of one - can keep your community frozen in time.&nbsp; It can perpetuate a negative image of the industry.&nbsp; It will hamper your efforts in expansion, fill or upgrade.&nbsp; It will prevent you from reaching the highest level of personal and professional excellence that is obtainable.&nbsp; To be more blunt, the lack of a promotion and marketing program that does good means you, your community, and the industry will suffer.&nbsp; It means that more people will neither believe nor share the positive messages the industry has to offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Concepts to a Successful Marketing Program&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>A successful promotion is a successful perception of value</li>	<li>Every day is Open House</li>	<li>Curb appeal is <u>your</u> job</li>	<li>Use white classifieds</li>	<li>Use reverse classifieds</li>	<li>Create a comparison grid for your community</li>	<li>Look at your community honestly  -  through the eyes of a video</li>	<li>Enforce your Guidelines for better curb appeal</li>	<li>Remember that word-of-mouth is your best advertising</li>	<li>Utilize business cards in new and creative ways</li>	<li>Everyone forms an opinion and every opinion matters</li>	<li>We are no better than others perceive us to be</li>	<li>Help retailers understand the values of your community</li>	<li>Allow them to use the amenities</li>	<li>Invite them to activities</li>	<li>Offer a special tour for new salespeople</li>	<li>Allow them to install model homes</li>	<li>Hang a lifestyle picture in their sales office</li>	<li>Visit on a regular basis</li>	<li>Use custom labels for bags of donuts or candy</li>	<li>Color code a map with vacant sites and sizes of homes</li>	<li>Send gift certificates to a salesman's spouse</li>	<li>Call to thank them for sending prospects</li>	<li>Consider using resident referrals</li>	<li>Free rent</li>	<li>Certificates for dinner</li>	<li>Mention in the newsletter</li>	<li>Create a win-win promotion</li>	<li>Give a shed, plants, gift certificate from nursery, deck, patio furniture, lawn mower, lawn care for six months, snow removal for a season, sod for the lawn, reduced water bill for watering</li>	<li>Take brochures to area businesses</li>	<li>Join the chamber of commerce and volunteer on committees</li></ul>",23,1,1465913937,1465921147,1,0,0,0,013176,16276,community_updates,und,Fair Housing Testing Leads to Discrimination Charges Against 23 Seattle Landlords,Null,23,1,1468254879,1511230069,1,0,0,0,013179,16279,community_updates,und,MHCO Legislative Update - 2016 Oregon Legislative Election,Null,23,1,1468455070,1512941616,1,0,0,0,013181,16281,community_updates,und,"Landlord Fined $5,000 for Refusing to Rent to Prospect with Section 8 Voucher",Null,23,0,1468972572,1511230134,1,0,0,0,013184,16284,community_updates,und,Bill to Reform Federal Housing Assistance Programs Sent to President - Includes Provision to Support Purchase of Manufactured Homes,Null,23,1,1469552065,1511229948,1,0,0,0,013190,16290,community_updates,und,"Oregonian Article: Rents in Seattle ($2k) and Portland ($1,764) are fastest growing in nation",Null,23,1,1469631557,1512941616,1,0,0,0,013215,16315,community_updates,und,MHCO Announces New Member Benefit - Rental Assistance Program,Null,23,1,1473284684,1511230134,1,0,0,0,013216,16316,community_updates,und,Oregon House Speaker Announces Major Push for Rent Control in 2017 Legislative Session,Null,23,1,1473829306,1512941616,1,0,0,0,013220,16320,community_updates,und,Sweet Dreams: Don't Let Overtime Exemption Issues Become Nightmares,Null,23,1,1475005535,1511230134,1,0,0,0,013232,16332,community_updates,und,The 2016 Election's Expected Impact on Manufactured Housing ,Null,23,1,1479138217,1512942175,1,0,0,0,013238,16338,community_updates,und,Federal Judge Puts New Overtime Rule on Hold,Null,23,1,1480432883,1512942131,1,0,0,0,013248,16348,community_updates,und,Vicki Coons: Why Mobile Homes are a Great Choice for Young Families,"<p>Vicki Coons is with Complete Mobile Home Sales and generously agreed to share this article with MHCO&nbsp;Members. &nbsp;Her contact information is listed below. &nbsp;MHCO is always excited to showcase an MHCO Associate Member.</p><p>At some point, you'll feel ready to settle down and start a family. Though it's an exciting new chapter in your life, you have to consider a lot of things first, from career plans to personal goals. You also have to take into account adjusting to the married life and eventually becoming a parent.</p><p>One of the most important preparations you have to think about is where to live. You want a decent place to raise your family  -  somewhere that you can truly call your home. Many young households today don't have a clear idea of where to settle down. Usually, they'd go for anything that's not pricey or isolated.</p><p>Manufactured houses are great options for young families. For the past few years, mobile homes have gained widespread popularity. From one end of the country to the other, you can find communities of pre-fabricated homes, particularly in places like Oregon.</p><p>If you are thinking about settling down or looking for a quality property to move into, take a look at the following to know why <em>manufactured homes in Oregon</em> are a great choice:</p><p><em>Pre-fabricated homes are affordable</em></p><p>Compared to brand new modern homes, <em>manufactured housing is an affordable alternative</em> for young families. You get more value for your investment. From the actual construction of the structure to maintenance and upgrades, the cost is significantly less than what you'd spend on a stick-built house. For a starting household, this is a great selling point.</p><p><em>Mobile homes are all about quality living</em></p><p>Affordability doesn't equate to inferior living standards. In fact, families are better off with mobile homes because they offer just the solutions they need. With the number of options available, they can choose the house that suits their situation. <em>Mobiles homes in Oregon</em>, for instance, vary in design and function. From elaborate floor plans to simple yet elegant house design, you can certainly find one that matches your preferences.</p><p><em>Green Living</em></p><p>Another less obvious yet equally striking benefit of mobile homes is green living. Builders don't waste a lot of materials during construction because they have complete control over the quality. The materials themselves are made of sustainable, eco-friendly components. As they are built with having a minimal impact to the environment in mind, in a way, you are giving back to nature. Residing in a mobile home can kick start your family's green living.</p><p><em>You belong to a community</em></p><p>No place is better for raising a family than in the safety of a community. Many mobile homes are located in communities and RV parks. Our listed <em>manufactured homes in Oregon</em>, for instance, are located in some of the prime spots in the country.</p><p><em>More financing options</em></p><p>There are also more financing options available for mobile homes. Here at Complete Mobile Homes, we work closely with local and national lending institutions. You can easily get the financing resource you need, so you can finally move into your manufactured house. You may consult with our team of manufactured home professionals to know more about your financing options.</p><p>Starting a family is a major decision, so is choosing a place to live. With all the benefits of living in a manufactured home in Oregon, deciding is now much easier to do. If you want the best for your family, a mobile home is for you.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.100000381469727px; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif !important;"">Vicki A.

While everyone is trying to figure out what the impacts of policy changes by the Trump administration will be on the economy, the stock market has surged and interest rates have climbed. Both of these occurrences reflect a positive reaction to the election in the financial marketplace, however the effect on real estate and income property values remains a concern for owners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Higher interest rates certainly impact the feasibility of borrowing money, which in turn affects the purchasing power for real estate acquisitions as well as property values. Most fixed rate lenders price their loans based on US Treasury yields. Many borrowers have been focusing on rising benchmark interest rates, however the good news is that US Treasury yields today are still far lower than their long term averages. As of March 7, 2017, the 10 year US Treasury yield stood at 2.51%, compared to 1.83% on November 7, 2016, the day before the election. The 10 year US Treasury yield began 2016 at 2.24%, and 2015 at 2.12%. To provide some perspective, below is the average yield on the 10 Year US Treasury during the last 5 decades, and so far in the 2010's:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1961 - 1969:&nbsp; 4.73%</p><p>1970 - 1979:&nbsp; 7.50%</p><p>1980 - 1989: 10.59%</p><p>1990 - 1999:&nbsp; 6.67%</p><p>2000 - 2009:&nbsp; 4.46%</p><p>2010 - 2016:&nbsp; 2.38%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have definitely enjoyed some very low interest rates over the last few years, which has benefitted borrowers and helped to support increasing property values. Most economists are predicting that ultimately Treasury yields have to return closer to these long term averages shown above, citing the Trump administration's mix of reflationary policy initiatives. Rates can always go down in the short term, however if the United States is successful at growing nominal gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years, Treasury yields could likely follow. Given this outlook, today's still historically-low interest rate environment offers an extraordinary opportunity to evaluate your near and long term financing objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding recent volatility due to the political climate and rising interest rates, the marketplace for income property financing remains very healthy, with no shortage of capital. Lenders remain optimistic for 2017, and most are planning to equal or exceed their loan origination volume from 2016. This includes lending for manufactured home communities (MHC's), an asset class of ever-increasing interest to capital providers. Volatility forces commercial lenders to gravitate towards lower risk, stable, income-producing real estate. Manufactured home communities are increasingly high on their lists, since the cash flow is consistent and demand for affordable housing is strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous institutional and private owners of manufactured home communities and other commercial real estate have taken advantage by locking in historically low fixed rate loans. In several cases, refinancing existing loans with prepayment penalties still made economic sense given the savings realized with today's low interest rate financing. If you've been considering a refinance to lower expenses, access additional capital to fund overdue projects, or facilitate additional acquisitions, it's still a great time to take a look at the programs available in today's market. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pool of varying capital sources deepened even further in 2016. Lender demand for existing, stabilized real estate transactions remains strong, despite escalated regulatory practices imposed on the industry. Over $1 Billion in commercial real estate loans will be maturing daily through the end of 2018, and the necessary lender appetite is present to service this need. Owners of manufactured home communities will benefit from this activity, as the capital marketplace for MHC's continues to expand and lenders are seeking to deploy capital on lower risk housing assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>An overview of community financing options for 2017:</u></p><p>As a result of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform policies and Basel III regulations imposed on banks, construction and high risk"" lending is tightening.

The first of these deadlines was last Friday, April 7th. As of midnight on last Friday any bill in a committee in the chamber of origin (Senate bills in the Senate and House bills in the House) must be scheduled for a hearing and work session or the bill will not be considered any further during this legislative session. The exceptions to this rule are bills in Revenue Committees, Rules Committees and Ways and Means Committees which stay open the duration of the legislative session. The remaining bills will need to move out of committees by April 18th.<br /><br />A number of bad legislative bills that MHCO has been fighting were stopped by last week's legislative deadline. However there are three bills that remain 'alive' that are of great concern:<br /><br />HB 2004A: Prohibits landlord from terminating month-to-month tenancy without cause after first six months of occupancy except under certain circumstances with 90 days' written notice and payment of [relocation expenses] amount equal to one month's periodic rent. Provides exception for cer- tain tenancies for occupancy of dwelling unit in building or on property occupied by landlord as primary residence. Makes violation defense against action for possession by landlord. Requires fixed term tenancy to become month-to-month tenancy upon reaching specific ending date, unless tenant elects to renew or terminate tenancy. Requires landlord to make tenant offer to renew fixed term tenancy. [Repeals statewide prohibition on city and county ordinances controlling rents.] Permits city or county to implement rent stabilization program for rental of dwelling units. This bill passed the Oregon House and is now being considered in the Senate.<br /><br />HB 2008: Requires landlord of manufactured dwelling park to pay tenant necessary relocation costs or applicable manufactured dwelling park closure penalty, as determined by Office of Manufactured Dwelling Park Community Relations, upon closure of park to convert to other use. Requires owner of manufactured dwelling park to give notice of final sale to office upon sale of park. Prohibits landlord from terminating without cause, unless under certain circumstances with 90 days' written notice, month-to-month tenancy consisting of rental of manufactured dwelling of float- ing home owned by landlord on space in facility. Requires fixed term tenancy consisting of rental of manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by landlord on space in facility to become month-to-month tenancy upon reaching specific end date, unless tenant elects to renew or terminate tenancy.

Scheduled for legislative work session on Thursday.<br /><br />We will be sending updates on the status of these three bills as they move through the legislative process. We are expecting significant amendments to HB 2008 but not enough to change MHCO's opposition. We are also expecting significant amendments in the Senate on HB 2004A. Again, the amendments will likely not change MHCO's opposition.<br /><br />MHCO was successful in negotiating a landlord-tenant coalition bill (SB 277). This bill will be significantly amended on Wednesday in the Senate. We were also successful in exempting manufactured home communities from HB 2511. Obviously, all the bad bills left behind so far this session are a success - but we still have a lot work ahead.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have reached the halfway point of the 2017 Legislative Session.

It is undeniable that material shifts in policy are in the works, social and economic alike. Some of these will likely have an effect on the commercial real estate lending environment, including financing for manufactured home communities (MHCs). The Trump administration is already taking a new approach to banking regulations, which may at some point include working with Congress on the future of the government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, both of which are active lenders to the MHC sector. More immediately, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank) is under review by the new administration in an effort to scale back regulations enacted during Obama's presidency. And, as if we didn't have enough change going on, many economists are predicting higher interest rates this year.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In 2016, FNMA and Freddie Mac continued to be reliable lending sources for multifamily and MHC properties while having remained in conservatorship since 2008. MHCs in 2016 were again excluded from the annual lending cap placed on the GSEs by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and consequently MHC loans were generally priced with interest rate spreads well inside of those for conventional apartment properties. In December 2016, the FHFA announced that MHCs would continue to be excluded from the lending caps in 2017, which came as welcomed news to MHC property owners and lenders alike. Since Freddie Mac and FNMA will not have a limit on the volume of MHC loans they can originate this year, we anticipate they will continue to price MHC loans aggressively.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While we appear to be in a state of business as usual"" with the GSEs in the near term",23,1,1492639088,1499640917,1,0,0,0,013321,16421,community_updates,und,Oregon Legislative Update - The Home Stretch - SB 277A and HB 2008A Head to Governor - Latest on Rent Control!,"<p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">&nbsp;We are in the home stretch of the 2017 Oregon Legislative Session.

Significant budget, tax, transportation issues still need to be haggled over as the legislative session draws to a close.<br /><br />Nearly all legislative proposals MHCO has been tracking (mostly opposed) have died in committee.<br /><br /><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/emma-assets/ahwab/a3305b6fbb83db8bf1326ccb04000c9b/MHCO_Legislative_Report_5-24-17.pdf"">Click Here or at the top of this article&nbsp;&nbsp;""MHCO&nbsp;Legislative Update"" &nbsp;for&nbsp;links to bill drafts and the status of all bills actively tracked by MHCO. </a><br /><br />Two significant legislative proposals addressing manufactured home communities are on their way to the Governor's desk for signature. Here is a summary of these two bills:<br /><br />SB 277A - This is the landlord tenant coalition bill that was negotiated over several months and addresses changes to disrepair and deterioration. The bill provides clear definitions of disrepair and deterioration as well as making it clear that cosmetic or aesthetic concerns are not disrepair or deterioration. The 30 day cure period is extended to 60 days. The bill also clarifies the responsibility of new residents who purchase an existing manufactured home in the community for repairs including cosmetic or aesthetic concerns as long as those concerns are included in the community rules and the community owner gives written notice to a prospective purchaser before he or she becomes a new resident.<br /><br />HB 2008A - this bill caused a great deal of anxiety for community owners when it was introduced in January. The original bill contained nearly every legislative concept that MHCO has been fighting against for the past 20 years. MHCO negotiated with John VanLandingham (Lane County Law Center) and Representatives Marsh, Fahey and the House Speaker to reach a compromise that removed nearly all of HB 2008 and replaced it with three issues.<br /><br />The first issue increases the amount homeowners are compensated when a community CLOSES from $5,000 (single wide), $7,000 (double wide), $9,000 (triple wide) to $6,000 (single wide), $8,000 (double wide), $10,000 (triple wide) and tied future increases in compensation to CPI.<br /><br />The second issue in the compromise addressed resident-owned communities. USDA Rural Development would like to pilot their 502 1% loan program in resident-owned cooperatives, however, they won't if there are restrictions requiring a lien holder to remove an abandoned or foreclosed MH after 12 months. The compromise will give resident-owned cooperatives the flexibility to negotiate storage terms with lien holders that are beneficial to the cooperative. This, in turn, will allow the cooperative to attract lenders who offer extremely affordable loan products to manufactured homeowners in cooperatives who wish to replace older or unsafe homes with new, energy-efficient ones.<br /><br />The third issue, when a community sells the new community owner will need to report to the state - the number of vacant spaces and homes in the manufactured dwelling park; the final sale price of the community; the date the conveyance became final; and the name, address and telephone number of the new owner.<br /><br />Finally, the other issue of great concern to all landlords is RENT CONTROL. HB 2004A (the rent control bill) is in the Senate. In March the HB 2004A passed out of the Oregon House and has had a public hearing in the Senate. Final action on the bill (work session) is scheduled for the end of May. There is no indication what the Senate will do, but a number of Democratic Senators have expressed opposition. At this time all eyes are on the Senate - we should have a good idea later next week on what direction the Senate will take on rent control and the elimination of 'no cause' eviction. We will keep you posted on any developments - all should be revealed within the next two weeks.<br /><br />MHCO Legal Counsel Phil Querin will do a complete analysis and provide practical advice for all MHCO members (managers and community owners) on these new laws later this summer. In addition all necessary changes to MHCO Forms will be made as well.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact the MHCO office at 503-391-4496. &nbsp;</p>",23,1,1495659994,1512941616,1,0,0,0,013323,16423,community_updates,und, MHCO Legislative Alert:  Oregon Senate Committee Drops Rent Control in Amendment to HB2004A ,"<p>This afternoon the Senate Committee on Human Services amended HB2004A with a dash 9 amendment that DOES NOT include rent stabilization, rent control or the elimination of the preemption of local rent control.

The DOJ became involved after the tenant filed a complaint with HUD.&nbsp;<br /><br />At trial, the resident, her treating therapist, and an independent expert testified that Riley assisted the resident in living with the symptoms of her disabilities, including providing emotional support, helping to predict migraines, and reducing suicidal thoughts. The resident also testified that she repeatedly informed the landlord that charging a deposit for a service animal was illegal, but the landlord continued to levy this charge and, at one point, threatened to evict her.&nbsp;<br /><br />The verdict includes $31,000 in compensatory damages and punitive damages for the resident, and $6,000 for a fair housing organization that assisted her with her HUD complaint.&nbsp;<br /><br />Persons with disabilities have the right to live in and enjoy their communities",23,1,1499811679,1512941802,1,0,0,0,013335,16435,community_updates,und,MHCO Legislative Update - 2017 Oregon Legislature Ends - House Speaker Vows To Continue Push for Rent Control,"<div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 12px;"">After working through much of the 4th of July weekend and holiday legislators wrapped up their legislative business today.

So - no rent control and no changes to 'no cause' eviction.&nbsp;<br /><br />These issues (rent control and 'cause eviction') will not be going away and will return in the 2018 'short' legislative session. House Speaker Kotek issued a press release earlier today stating - ""We made good progress, but we need to do more to protect renters from staggering rent spikes and no- cause evictions. In 2018, we will push to finish this session's unfinished business on housing ..."". The war on Oregon landlords continues ... stay tuned!<br /><br />All in all a rough legislative session but the end result should please everyone. Our success this session would not have been possible without the active engagement of MHCO members. Thanks to everyone who showed up for Lobby Day in February, sent emails, called legislators, showed up and testified at critical public hearings. Without YOUR INVOLVEMENT we would have faced a very different outcome. The quality and quantity of YOUR INVOLVEMENT made the difference.

Nonetheless, 2018 is positioned to be another very strong year from a real estate capital markets perspective. Providers of capital across the industry are planning to match or exceed their lending and investment volume from last year. 2017 saw the manufactured home community (MHC) industry continue to benefit from a growing shortage of affordable housing in markets across the United States. Furthermore, demand increases have outpaced supply for MHC assets, a trend that should continue throughout 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most investors and capital providers believe that 2018 will be an excellent time to consume and deploy capital, either by selling assets, acquiring value-add acquisitions, or taking advantage of attractive fixed and floating rate financing. Capitalization rates (the rate of return) for well-located, quality manufactured home communities remain aggressively low, as relatively slow deal flow cannot keep pace with the amount of desired equity deployment from institutional and private investors. Thus, we continue to see more flexible investment strategies across the board, as groups struggle to deploy a plentiful amount of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an example, we have seen institutional and private investors with a traditional focus on Class A (top quality) MHC's in major U.S. metro areas expand their focus to include Class B and C properties in these same markets, or in secondary or smaller U.S. markets. The continuing disappearance of distressed acquisition opportunities, and the unwillingness of owners of Class A MHC's to sell, has forced certain investors to look at value-add deals that require more complex business plans to achieve acceptable investment returns. Buyers acquiring MHC's are still benefitting from very attractive fixed and floating interest rate financing, and interest-only payments, which help support higher transaction price points. Furthermore, investors understand that most assets will continue to benefit from additional revenue growth over the course of the coming years, and are often willing to factor this growth into present day valuations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From an MHC financing perspective, liquidity continues to increase and various capital sources are showing more flexibility and aggressiveness as they try to keep pace with their dollar volume allocations. This translates to a very favorable financing environment for owners and buyers of MHC's.&nbsp;Life insurance companies are generally increasing real estate allocations, and can offer extremely attractive non-recourse long term financing solutions (up to 40 years) for owners looking to lock in today's still low interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen life company lenders reduce credit spreads (the method by which loan interest rates are priced), lengthen amortization schedules, and provide interest-only payment options before amortization kicks in.

Democrats need to pick up just one seat in the House and Senate to achieve the three-fifths supermajority necessary to pass bills raising revenue without Republican support.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Tuesday's primaries included 16 seats up for grabs in the Senate, with five Democrats running unopposed. All 60 seats were up in the House, with seven Republicans and 24 Democrats running unopposed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>SENATE DISTRICT 24</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">This East Portland district was one of the most closely watched and high-spending races in the May primary, with civil rights attorney Shemia Fagan handing a decisive defeat to five-term Democratic incumbent Rod Monroe. Fagan won 62 percent to Monroe's 25 percent. Kayse Jama, a 43-year-old Somali immigrant and community organizer collected 13 percent of the vote.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Monroe, 75, a five-term senator, was vulnerable because the race centered on housing. The owner of a 51-unit apartment complex in East Portland, Monroe alienated tenant advocates and fellow Democrats last year when he opposed a bill that would have restricted evictions and allowed some rent controls.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Monroe spent heavily to defend his seat, raising nearly $385,000 -- much of it from the real estate industry -- and spent most of it. A group largely funded by the real estate industry also raised more than $360,000 and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/05/campaign_spending_surges_in_ea.html"">spent much of it on polling in support of Monroe and advertising against Fagan</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">That wasn't enough to fend off Fagan, who moved into Monroe's Senate district last year. The Happy Valley resident has raised $310,000, with big contributions from the state's public employee unions and the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. The recently formed political action committee A Progressive Voice for Oregon also paid for advertising against Monroe, although the committee funded mostly by trial lawyers and public employee unions did not disclose the purpose of most of its $66,000 in reported spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Fagan made affordable housing her top priority and said she would put an end to no-cause evictions and allow cities to enact rent controls.</span></p><p style=""margin-left:-40.5pt;"">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>SENATE DISTRICT 11</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Senate President Peter Courtney<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;a Salem Democrat, faced his first primary challenger in 20 years. Though Courtney handily beat Joyce Judy -- 65 percent to 35 percent -- the race put the state's longest-serving current lawmaker and most-tenured Senate president in the position of defending his record against attacks by Judy and other more liberal Democrats.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>SENATE DISTRICT 3</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">This is poised to be a pivotal race in the general election, potentially giving Democrats the additional position needed to achieve a supermajority in the Senate. It opened up after Republican Sen. Alan DeBoer decided not to seek reelection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Democrats had four candidates: community services nonprofit employee Kevin Stine, television producer Jeff Golden, behavioral health administrator Athena Goldberg and physician Julian Bell. Golden had a decisive lead Tuesday evening, with 52 percent of the vote. Athena Goldberg trailed with 36 percent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">On the Republican side, technology company founder and CEO Jessica Gomez claimed victory with 54 percent of the vote, over certified public accountant Curt Ankerberg's 46 percent. Gomez also<a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/02/oregon_state_senator_plans_to.html"">&nbsp;worked as one of DeBoer's legislative aides</a>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>HOUSE DISTRICT 32</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">This Democratic primary was likely the most-watched House race among political insiders. It pitted Tim Josi, a full-time Tillamook County Commissioner backed by outgoing Rep. Deborah Boone, against two rivals running to the left of Josi. Child welfare worker Tiffiny Mitchell, who moved to Oregon from Utah about three years ago, led with 39 percent Tuesday night and Josi had 31 percent. John Orr, who splits his time between part-time jobs as a municipal court judge and biomass energy contractor, followed with 30 percent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">A central issue in the race was whether public employees should begin contributing to the public pension fund. Orr and Mitchell said the state should not require public employees to contribute. Josi said the state should consider requiring employees to put money into the fund, but said he remains undecided on the issue.</span></p><p style=""margin-left:-40.5pt;"">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>HOUSE DISTRICT 20</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Selma Pierce, a retired dentist from Salem, was recruited by House leadership to challenge the potentially vulnerable Democratic incumbent, Paul Evans. She easily bested her opponent in the Republican primary, garnering 61 percent of ballots versus Kevin Chambers' 39 percent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Pierce, the wife of former gubernatorial candidate Bud Pierce, is a longtime volunteer in the Salem area and says she'll prioritize improving graduation rates and vocational education; providing more robust services to those suffering mental health issues<strong>;&nbsp;</strong>and private sector affordable housing solutions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">This is a swing district some consider to be the closest in the state. Democrats have only a 3.6 percentage point registration margin and Evans, an Air Force veteran and Western Oregon University professor, eked out a victory by less than 2,000 votes in 2016.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>HOUSE DISTRICT 52</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Democrats have long set their sights on this district, and the departure of former Rep. Mark Johnson last year to take a short-lived job leading a business group put the seat in play.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">On the Republican side, Rep. Jeffrey Helfrich -- who was<a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/democrats_will_pick_oregons_ne.html"">&nbsp;selected by county commissioners</a>&nbsp;to serve the remainder of Johnson's term -- was the clear winner with 98 percent of the vote.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Democrats fielded educator and environmental activist Aurora del Val<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>who fought the Nestle water bottling proposal, and academic adviser Anna Williams. Del Val withdrew from the race earlier this year but was still on the ballot. Williams held a large lead with 77 percent over del Val's 22 percent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>HOUSE DISTRICT 26</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Gun control was a central issue in this Republican primary.

In other words, the so-called ""stability'' mentioned by the city, is achieved by preventing MHC owners from closing their parks and converting them to other uses. While it is true that park owners may apply for a zone change and comprehensive plan amendment if they want to close their park and convert it to another use, the same is true for any other owner of property anywhere else in the city, who wishes to establish a new use that is otherwise prohibited by the city's current zoning code and comprehensive plan. Therefore, the fact that an owner can apply for a zone change and comprehensive plan amendment if they wish to close their park and convert it to another use, does not negate the fact that under the propose MHC amendments, conversion to another use would be prohibited.</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.6px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">MHCO has retained attorneys Bill Miner and Phil Grillo at Davis Wright Tremaine&nbsp;</span><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">to assist our efforts opposing Portland's latest attack on property rights.&nbsp; MHCO is concerned that this ordinance impacts many MHC owners in Portland and has the potential of becoming a significant issue for all park owners in Oregon in next year's legislative session.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.6px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">MHCO has held several meetings with Portland officials and some progress appears to be possible, although it may be too early to be certain.&nbsp; Our goal has been to keep current community owners whole - working on concepts that preserves the value of the property.&nbsp; We will be working on this issue through the summer and will keep you up to date as we move forward.</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.6px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">One concept that we are working on is bonus density.&nbsp; The basic concept is that where a MHC site is underdeveloped (meaning that the zoning would allow more units than currently exist on site) the city would allow owners a density bonus that can be transferred (i.e. sold) &nbsp;to the owners of other residentially zoned properties in the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, this concept is known in the planning world as Transfer of Development Rights (TDR).&nbsp; Our density bonus concept would expand the basic TDR concept proposed by the city, to ensure that all MHC owners have a meaningful amount of density (i.e. dwelling units) that can be transfer (i.e. sold) to other residentially zoned properties.&nbsp; Our concept would also expand the area (i.e. residentially zoned properties) &nbsp;whether this bonus density could be transferred to, thereby expanding the market area and presumably increasing the value of the proposed bonus density.</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.6px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">MHCO would like to thank attorneys Bill Miner and Phil Grillo who have provided most of the back ground for this email and for their efforts on behalf of community owners.</span>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>",23,1,1529963742,1529963742,1,0,0,0,013463,16563,community_updates,und,A True Opportunity to Purchase - A Landlord's Overt Offer to Tenants and CASA of Oregon,"<p>By Dale Strom</p><p>Dale&nbsp;Strom&nbsp;is a second generation Manufactured Home Community landlord.

Friedman - The Oregonian/OregonLive</p><p>Published 8-20-18</p><p>The Portland City Council will&nbsp;soon consider an ordinance to cap what landlords can charge for security deposits and limit how they may use renters' credit and criminal conviction history to deny them tenancy.</p><p>""Screening criteria and security deposit reform"" will be the subject of an upcoming council agenda item, Commissioner Chloe Eudaly wrote in an August 14 post to her Facebook page. The ordinance is scheduled for a hearing September 20, said Eudaly spokeswoman Margaux Weeke.</p><p>It is exactly the kind of move that Oregon landlords feared when they&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/08/landlords_prep_for_new_fights.html"">banded together</a>&nbsp;to try to raise $2 million to fight those and other restrictions they say will undermine their businesses.</p><p>Policymakers in other cities have also explored regulating security deposits, citing mounting pressures on renters who struggle to save up cash for move-in fees. New York City's comptroller in July introduced a deposit-limiting measure. The Seattle City Council adopted a similar ordinance in December 2016, and landlords filed a lawsuit to challenge it.</p><p>In Portland, landlords may currently charge what they like as a security deposit, and there are few regulations over how deposits must be returned after a tenant vacates. That would change under&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/article/695056"">Eudaly's ordinance</a>. In the Facebook post, Eudaly described one an effect of the ordinance as ""limit security deposit requirements.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ordinance would also change how landlords may use information about potential tenants. Property owners typically perform criminal records and credit history checks on rental applicants. Some renter advocates have described the background checks as offering landlords a pretense for discriminating against those with criminal pasts or poor credit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eudaly said&nbsp;in her Facebook post that changing how landlords may use information about rental applicants&nbsp;to deny them tenancy is in part intended to ""reduce barriers to housing"" and ""prevent discrimination.""</p><p>According to a draft of the ordinance provided by Eudaly's office, she has considered establishing a system that requires landlords to approve tenants on a first-come, first-served basis, though a minimum credit score would still be allowed.</p><p>To deny applicants, landlords would be required to rank applicants on their credit history, criminal convictions and housing record and give them a chance to provide favorable information. &nbsp;</p><p>The draft ordinance includes a list of crimes that are not to be judged by landlords as meaning a tenant convicted of them would likely&nbsp;harm the property or cause the premises to be unsafe, if the applicant was sentenced at least three years prior or released from prison one year prior. The list&nbsp;includes felony assault and battery, felony burglary or breaking-and-entering, stalking and misdemeanor domestic violence, dealing or manufacturing illegal drugs, and non-forcible sex offenses, among others.</p>",23,1,1534814228,1534820221,1,0,0,0,013500,16600,community_updates,und,Oregonian Editorial: Eudaly's Proposed Tenant Protections Miss The Mark,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oregonian Editorial Board</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Printed 9-16-18</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Portland's elected officials are doing their part to promote the $652.8 million regional housing bond going to voters this November.

Because regardless of the bond's success or failure, the duration and severity of this housing crisis hinge on whether leaders encourage the market as a whole to add more housing or quash it.</p><p>Unfortunately, a&nbsp;<a href=""http://media.oregonlive.com/opinion_impact/other/2018/09/16/Screening%20Criteria%20Framework-DRAFT%2017.pdf"">sweeping proposal</a>&nbsp;being developed by Portland City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly falls squarely in the latter category.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eudaly announced months ago that her office was looking at the process with which&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/08/security_deposits_tenant_backg.html"">landlords screen potential tenants</a>. The intent, policy director Jamey Duhamel told The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, is to ensure fair rental practices while helping needy renters, whose monthly income, criminal background, or credit history would typically turn off potential landlords.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The motivation seems understandable. The method, however, leaves much to be desired. Eudaly's&nbsp;<a href=""http://media.oregonlive.com/opinion_impact/other/2018/09/16/Screening%20Criteria%20Framework-DRAFT%2017.pdf"">eight-page proposal</a>&nbsp;as currently drafted is heavy-handed, overly complicated and forces so much financial and legal risk onto landlords that many may opt to leave the rental business altogether. And the bigger question remains: How do these policies make housing any more affordable?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2018/08/20/landlords-outraged-by-commissioner-chloe-eudalys-proposal-to-limit-screenings-of-tenant-criminal-history/"">many concerns in the latest version</a>&nbsp;released: landlords aren't allowed to require that applicants show&nbsp;a monthly income of more than twice the monthly rent, even though three times monthly rent is more typical as assurance that a tenant can afford the payments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Landlords must go through an extensive and confusing matrix of questions in evaluating whether an applicant's criminal history merits a denial. And landlords must issue a written explanation to tenants who are denied after being vetted. The ""notice of denial"" must detail the reasons for turning down the applicant and establish that they are ""highly and substantially more probably to be true than not that the applicant as a tenant will adversely affect the substantial, legitimate, non-discriminatory interest of the landlord.""</p><p>It's not just a daunting set of poorly-written requirements. It's also an invitation to rejected applicants to sue.</p><p>Duhamel said Eudaly's office is focusing on how to ""fine-tune"" the proposal, which is tentatively scheduled to go before the City Council next month, to ease the administrative burden. But&nbsp;the flaws in the policy aren't going to be fixed by fine-tuning. The problems are baked into the fundamental assumptions underlying the policy.</p><p>For example, the screening proposal seems to assert that the city - not landlords - should get to decide how much financial risk landlords should bear. Citizens have not and should not hand over that kind of authority to city commissioners who believe their policy choices trump an individual's financial autonomy.</p><p>It also fails to consider that there are many landlords and affordable-housing groups that already accept tenants with criminal histories or credit problems. They do so not by following a rigid list of criteria but after considering the mix of tenants or other location-specific issues that make a tenant more suitable in one building than another.</p><p>And it neglects to address&nbsp;<a href=""http://cityobservatory.org/portlands-brouhaha-over-housing-market-economics-101/"">the underlying reason that people are struggling</a>&nbsp;to find affordable places to live - a lack of housing on every income level caused by years of underbuilding. Instead, such onerous mandates on landlords - with limited ways to protect against the risk - could prompt some to drastically raise rent when units become vacant or take the property out of the rental market entirely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Duhamel said that, in her opinion, only a handful of landlords would likely get out of the business altogether, dismissing ""what if"" concerns as ""fearmongering."" But she acknowledges the city has no data on how a previous policy - mandatory relocation assistance to tenants whose leases are not renewed - may have affected the rental market.</p><p>Others,&nbsp;who&nbsp;admittedly represent&nbsp;the landlord viewpoint, say it has definitely led to the loss of many rentals. Since the beginning of the year, 30 landlords who used the Garcia Group property management firm decided to sell their properties, owner Ron Garcia told The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board. That's a tenth of the ownership portfolio, he said, and many of the properties were condos or single-family homes that likely went to buyers seeking to occupy, rather than rent, the property.</p><p>The region's housing crisis is real with thousands of homeless people living on the street and many more on the brink as wages don't keep pace with rent. But landlords' screening policies aren't the reason Portland is in a housing crisis. Leaders should focus on the true culprit - the need for more housing at all income levels - and make sure they don't unwittingly become an accomplice.</p><p><em>-Helen Jung for The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",23,1,1537376979,1537376979,1,0,0,0,013501,16601,community_updates,und,Generic MHC Rules and Regulations,<p>Over the years many MHCO members have asked for a generic set of rules and regulations. &nbsp;Attached is a copy of a generic set for your review. &nbsp;Please be advised that any changes to &nbsp;existing rules&nbsp;will require following a process outlined in statute (ORS 90.610) for residents currently living in your community. &nbsp;MHCO&nbsp;has developed <strong>FORM 60</strong>&nbsp;to use when&nbsp;changing&nbsp;your rules and regulations. &nbsp;Your community rules are for you to develop and implement. &nbsp;Hopefully this set of generic rules and regulations will give you some ideas for where your rules fall short. &nbsp;<em><u><strong>Remember - all rules and regulations need to be implemented consistently and thoroughly.</strong></u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>,23,1,1537458623,1537459766,1,0,0,0,013504,16604,community_updates,und,Housing Affordability Bill Introduced in the US Senate,"<p>On September 26, 2018, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced S. 3503, the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which seeks to help bring down costs for renters and buyers and level the playing field so working families everywhere can find a decent place to live at a decent price.""""

This was an error, as manufactured housing tenancies were specifically excluded in the last subsection of the statute.

Riverbend MHP is a 39 space community located within the city limits of Clatskanie, OR.</em></p><p><em>The fourth part of this series covered a period of time immediately after the tenants met with representatives from CASA to early October where both parties were anticipating to sign a purchase agreement on November 1. This period of time of will encompass almost 5 months.</em></p><p><em>The author is called by both CASA's Executive Director and the Development Manager. Obviously, there is something that isn't going according to schedule. Obviously, November 1 will come and go without the completion of the sale.</em></p><p>Before we get back to the phone call from CASA, a few details that occurred after September 1 were not mentioned in the<em>fourth</em><em> part of this series</em>.</p><p>THE PAPERWORK PROCESS - The Cooperative requested an appraisal on Riverbend for the purpose of financing. An application for Capital Needs Assessment was required to fund the appraisal. Although this process was a few days late, this shouldn't delay the sale, if any, at all. The request for the appraisal was made on or around September 17. The completed appraisal was submitted to the State on October 16.</p><p>The appraisal, once completed, is the last and remaining document for the application process. The application then activates the underwriting process. When the State grants its approval of the underwritten application, it is then forwarded to the Oregon Housing Stability Council (HSC) for the final approval. So, who then gives the financing approval?</p><p>Grant agreements are then drafted and agreed to by CASA, the Cooperative and the Department of Justice for comments and approval of the funds needed to finance this purchase agreement. Once the agreement has gone through the many approvals and those signatures have been secured, the sale then gets the go ahead. The closing is all that remains.&nbsp;</p><p>PARK OPERATIONS - Always in the back of my mind in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter of each year is budgeting and my assessment for a need to increase the rent. Scheduled rent increases that I have asked of the tenants usually takes place on January 1. If the sale does not go through as expected, I will need to start in late September on implementing the increase.</p><p>All Oregon MHP landlords know that when they feel that they must increase their rents, that landlord will immediately turn to their Oregon Revised Statutes and go directly go to ORS 90.600. Those landlords will then be reminded that all tenants will need to be given a 90 day notification upon a landlords need for such an increase. In this case, I needed to get my notifications in the mail by September 26 to insure that the tenants did get their notices by September 30 in time for the January 1 implementation. (In Oregon, a tenant needs to be properly served via first class mail so that the notices are in their possession for the full 90 days before the rent is due).</p><p>My tenants were now aware that if I was still the owner of the community on January, their rents were now to be increased from $370 to $380 per month for the New Year. (Yes, that is the going rate of MHP rents in the small city). The request for the rent increase at the beginning of the year would become prophetic in more than one way.</p><p>Now we have an appraisal, capital needs assessment, an application, a submittal to the State for underwriting, approval by HSC for final approval, financing and finally approval by the Department of Justice, CASA and the Cooperative. And then we are ready for a closing on November 1. What could possibly go wrong???</p><p>Receiving the phone call from the Executive Director and Development Manager of CASA, they informed me that the events of their due diligence, application and approval process leading to a final sale was running behind their timeline. Their request was that we agree to and move back the closing date to March 1.</p><p>If you remember from the first part of this series, I wanted to sell this community for several reasons. I thought that the possible sale to the tenants would work for me because I was not going to exercise my 1031 option and I wanted to sell but didn't need to sell. The exemption of the State Capital Gains was another huge benefit that does not go ignored. I could wait when the purchasing party was ready.</p><p>I also mentioned in the first part of the series that my terms on selling would increase the Ernest Money by $10,000 per month for 2 months for any delay by the buyer for this sale.</p><p>CASA did want to delay the sale of the park back to March 1 because of delays of the process that the buyer needs to achieve in this process. It appears that the delay could possibly be with the Department of Justice. It has been suggested to me that the DOJ accomplishes its work on its timeline and doesn't have any kind of fast track program for this type of case. Whatever the delays were, the Ernest Money was increased by $20,000.</p><p>Then there is the case of my onsite manager. She has been there the entire 12 _ years that I have owned the community. She has spoken to me over the past 2 or more years about retirement and spending more time for herself and family. She does not want the responsibility of park management anymore. My agreement with my manager when I signed the Purchase Agreement was that she would work for me until November 1. This was extended another month, when the extension by CASA was requested. My manager still resides in the park and will continue to live there as a tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, I have also been in frequent contact with the Coop board President and the Treasurer about the status of the park. This can lead to problems of a conflict of interest here although the best interest of the Community is most important to both parties. I continue to speak with the onsite manager regarding the status of the park. When it is necessary to speak with the 2 board members, usually the conversation will swerve into the current status of the park and how some issues need immediate attention. With all that has occurred since the formation of the board for the Cooperative, I can honestly say that I have had a great working relationship with both the President and the Treasurer. Also adding that they, in no way, have acted in my behalf to take care of any issues that I have a need to accomplish. I have seen this as phasing out my current manager and bring in the new ownership.</p><p>I do look forward to closing this deal in that we have been working on this sale for almost 5 months. Now I look at this delay from another standpoint. We are getting late in 2018. Pushing this sale back into 2019 will make tax planning much easier in that I have more time to do that planning. In addition, the rent increase will be implemented on schedule on January 1. It became prophetic in that the $380 rent is the amount that the Cooperative will start asking its members upon closing.</p><p>It remains to be seen if this rent in the long run can be sustained by the Cooperative or if an adjustment of the rent will need to be made.</p><p>Now that we are targeting the close sometime in the first quarter of 2019, I can now anticipate enjoying the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But I also need to find the proper way to sell"" the 2 park owned homes to the ""occupants"" (not a complete legal description of the habitants) of those homes.</p><p>Recently",23,1,1548290449,1548290879,1,0,0,0,013550,16650,community_updates,und,Phil Querin Analysis of SB 608 (Rent Control),"<p>Attached is Phil Querin's&nbsp;detailed analysis of SB 608 (Rent Control). &nbsp;SB 608 will be up for a public hearing on Monday, February 4th&nbsp;at 3 pm. &nbsp;Information on written and public testimony will be forth coming early next week. &nbsp;</p>",23,1,1548608685,1548608747,1,0,0,0,013551,16651,community_updates,und,"Rent Control Hearing Monday, Februay 4th at 3 PM  Hearing Room 'B'","<div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Oregon Legislature has scheduled a public hearing on SB 608 (Rent Control - Elimination of No Cause Eviction) for Monday, February 4, 2019 at 3 PM at the Oregon State Capitol, Hearing Room 'B', Oregon Senate Committee on Housing.</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;""><strong><em><u>This is an ""all hands on deck"" for owners of manufactured housing communities.</u></em></strong>&nbsp; This legislative proposal has the potential to make grave changes to Oregon Landlord/Tenant law and is by far the most serious threat we have faced in the last two decades.
