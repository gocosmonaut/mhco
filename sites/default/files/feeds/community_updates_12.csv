Let's not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.</p><p>What do the Regulations say?  ""...The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] ... must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community.  Such updates must take place once every two years ....""</p><p>For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome.  HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information ""will be readily available in the files.""</p><p>This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date).  One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement.  HUD emphasizes that ""...the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again  -  only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.""</p><p>It is also clear that the survey is a ""summary"" and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident's file): ""[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation.  The word 'summary' has been added to this section"").</p><h2>Compilation of the ""Summary""</h2><p>In review of the files to compile the required ""summary,"" it is possible that some files may be missing POA (Proof of Age) documentation.  Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy.  This can be fatal to defending a ""55+"" status.  Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent.  Perhaps a resident's tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to ""grandfather"" underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant's age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced.  None of these explanations will ""wash"" with fair housing enforcers.  Now is the time for review of this information.  Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the ""55+"" status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation.  HUD's requirements are crystal clear: ""The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.""</p><h2>Should you seek missing POA information?</h2><p>Yes.  In a large scale review of resident files by fair housing enforcers, the main objective for review of proof of age may be to establish the 80-20 ratio: Proof of age in the file may itself be seen as evidence of adherence to collection of required data:  even after-acquired information reflects, at least, compliance with the 2-year survey requirement.  Proof of age includes</p><p>the following: driver's license (an expired or out-of-state license seems 'ok'), birth certificate, passport, immigration card, military identification, any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of ""comparable reliability.""  This may include birth certificates, baptismal or marriage documents, perhaps, and other public records.</p><h2>What if the tenant refuses to provide proof of age?</h2><p>New purchaser:  Of course, refusal to supply proof of age when applying for tenancy is a basis for denying a tenancy application.  The regulations also allow for a declaration from a member of the household over 18 years of age, stating that at least one person in the homesite is at least 55 years of age.  This after-acquired information is permissible for the survey, but again does not bolster evidence of conformance to proof of age documentation required for tenancy approval.</p><p>HUD provides a skeletal sample of certification.  This can also be used as part of the tenancy application alone or better yet as a backup to production of proof of age.  The sample reads as follows: ""I, (name), am 18 years of age or older and a member of the household that resides at (housing facility or community), (unit number or designation).  I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge of the ages of the occupants of this household and that at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older.""  Actual proof of age should be obtained at the application stage to avoid false reporting  -  no defense to a failure to achieve the 80-20 ration.</p><p>The regs also allow for other proof of age if an existing resident refuses to provide it.  HUD states that ""[I]f the occupants ... refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the [management] may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.  Such evidence may include: (1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census; (2) Prior forms or applications; or (3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants.  The individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.""</p><p>Thus, the survey could be supplemented by including a sworn declaration or affidavit by any person with personal knowledge of the age of the resident's age.  In past cases where proof of age was critically important, private investigation of public records to obtain that information has been conducted to provide such knowledge.  Remember however, that obtaining proof of age ""after the fact"" shows compliance with the 2-year survey requirement, but does not substitute for a consistent practice of securing the required information at the time of processing the tenancy application.</p><p>HUD gives the following example as acceptable: ""the owner of a mobile home park where the residents own the coach but rent the land requires a statement of whether at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older before any sublease or new rental.""  In other words, the qualification procedure can be instituted within the application process itself.  HUD states such an example (""All new leases, new purchase agreements, or new applications contain a provision directly above the signatory line for leases, asserting that at least one occupant or the swelling will be 55 years of age or older.  In addition the community surveys all current residents for their occupancy status in compliance with the 55 - or-older requirements"").  Actual proof of age should always be required with submission of the tenancy application as well.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The continuing survey requirement is mandatory.  Whether failure to comply will be fatal to the assertion of ""older persons"" status is unknown, but this survey requirement is part of the ""intent"" prong of operating an ""older persons"" community.  In sum, it is time to compile the summary for your park.</p><p>(Reprinted with permission from MHI)</p><h2>Do you operate a 55 &amp; Older Community?</h2><h2>Do you have the necessary MHCO Forms for 55 &amp; Older Communities?</h2><h2>MHCO has the Resources You Need!</h2><p>If you are one of the many members of MHCO who own and operate a 55 &amp; Older manufactured home community - MHCO has the resources you need to keep that community compliant with current HUD rules.</p><ul><li>Addendum      to the Rent/Lease Agreement for Age 55 &amp; Older Communities (MHCO Form      71A)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community - Occupation Determination and Age Verification      (MHCO Form 71B)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community HUD Verification of Occupancy Survey (MHCO Form 71C)</li></ul><p>These are excellent tools to use in the effective management of your 55 &amp; Older community.

Dowdall, Esq.</strong></p><p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status."" In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class. This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement. This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p><h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination. Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity. Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms? A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a test-case. In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following. If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul>	<li>Children under the age of fourteen (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Children under the age of eight (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of the family residence;</li>	<li>Children shall not be allowed to play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li>	<li>Residents and visitors under the age of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy. These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning äóñ No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol>	<li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li>	<li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li>	<li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li>	<li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine äóñ in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li>	<li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service äóñ disseminating information and facts äóñ not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five. Consumers should keep a locked safety cover on the spa whenever it is not in use and keep children away unless there is constant adult supervision. Hot Tub Temperatures äóñ CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa. High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning. In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death. In 1987, CPSC helped develop requirements for temperature controls to make sure that spa water temperatures never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Pregnant women and young children should not use a spa before consulting with a physician. ...

Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe. Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission. Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from trafficäóñrelated pedestrian death and injury.

Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that between 1985 and 1989, the latest period for which data are available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers because of contact with exercise bikes. Most children were under the age of five. Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly. The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious. Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes. Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it. Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""

Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the seller of the manufactured home.</p><p>If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.</p><p>It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.</p><p>It is important that you advise anyone that has a ""For Sale"" sign on their manufactured home that they do the three things listed at the beginning of this section.  Failure by the prospective resident to fill out an application or the landlord's failure to advise them that they do not qualify can be a very costly mistake in the event they move in and then you give them notice.

Use the Park Rules &amp; Regulations as a briefing tool.  The conversation should not be a ""laying down of the law"", but rather an open discussion of what is expected of both the new resident and community management.  New residents may not know their responsibilities (despite signing numerous documents outlining their rights/responsibilities), thus it is your responsibility to clarify and remind them of their responsibilities.  Be sure your new resident understands such things as:</p><ol><li>Rent is due on the first of each month:<ol><li>If rent is paid after the 5th day, the residents will be faced with a late fee.</li><li>If not paid by the 8th day, the resident will receive a 72-hour notice.</li><li>Residents must give 30 days written notice to vacate space or they intend to sell their manufactured home.</li></ol></li><li>Help your new resident be a good neighbor.

All other existing tenants shall receive a copy of the statement of policy upon expiration of their current rental agreement and before signing a new agreement.</p><p>While a Statement of Policy is not technically a contract, it is an important document.  A tenant or rental applicant who makes their decisions or changes their position in reliance upon the policies set forth in the statement may be entitled to hold the landlord to those written policies.  As proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy to tenants or applicants, it is advised to get a signed receipt.</p><p>A landlord who intentionally and deliberately fails to provide a Statement of Policy as required by ORS 90.510, or delivers a legally defective one, may be subject to a lawsuit.</p><p>The Statement of Policy is required to include the following information in summary form:</p><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;""><li>The location and approximate size of the space to be rented.</li><li>The federal fair housing age classification and present zoning that affect the use of the rented space.</li><li>The facility policy regarding rent adjustment and a rent history for the space to be rented.

Remember, you want to sell the prospective resident on your community, but you also want them to make a well informed decision.</p><p>Providing a prospective resident's with extensive information regarding your manufactured home community allows the applicant to evaluate for themselves if they qualify.

This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your ""Screening Criteria"" is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  That is up to you.  Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial  -  it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example  -  maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older  -  it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.</p><p>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations  -  write a ""screening criteria"" and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone  -  even if they are in a protected class  -  if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will ""self screen"" themselves by reading your ""screening criteria"" and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.</p><p>Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance.  This may include:</p><ul><li>Unsatisfactory rental references</li><li>Applicant must be 18 years or older</li><li>Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant's photo from a government office (i.e. Driver's License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card</li><li>Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.</li><li>If the community is either an ""age 55 or older"" or an ""age 62 or older"" Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements</li><li>The absence of any prior tenant history or credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory credit history</li><li>Unsatisfactory character references</li><li>Any criminal history</li><li>Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations</li><li>Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets</li><li>Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items</li><li>If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement</li><li>The number of additional occupants</li><li>Adverse information contained in the public record</li></ul><p>Additional criteria that may be added to qualify could include:</p><ul><li>Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords</li><li>No payment of rent problems over the past two years</li><li>Two years of verifiable employment</li><li>No criminal convictions</li><li>No tax liens</li><li>Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent</li><li>Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy</li><li>Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.</li><li>If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed.  Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs.  You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community</li><li>You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.</li><li>Homes must be owner occupied  -  no subleasing</li></ul><p>You MUST post your community's screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.</p><p><strong>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions!</strong> Once you make an exception for one of your criteria you are opening up the possibility of future problems.  You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations and do not make exceptions to your screening criteria.  Take the time to put your screening criteria in writing to protect yourself and provide prospective residents with a copy so that they can have the necessary information upon which to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Remember  -  you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or source of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone  -  even if they are in a protected class  -  if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.</strong></p><p>For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic.  However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.</p><p>Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law.

Exemptions for specific industries have been granted as late as the first week of December 2010.  MHCO and MHI are conducting research on this topic and will be providing additional information as it becomes available.  The Federal Trade Commission  link is http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/redflagsrule/index.shtml   and contains a lot of information that should be of interest to community owners and manufactured home community retailers.  If you are subject to the new rule there is a template developed by the FTC for businesses at low risk for identity theft at this site.  While we are still looking into this and monitoring developments in the Congress, it is likely that if a community owner is not billing for utilities, is not providing loans for residents purchasing homes, and is not acting as a retailer selling homes, they are not probably covered by the Red Flags Rule.</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule: What You Need to Know</h2><p>As of June 1, 2010 the Federal Trade Commission has begun enforcement of the 'Red Flags' rule which mandates creditors and financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs. It's important to spend some time discussing the rule, including what it is and what it means for you</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule - In Plain English</h2><p>The full title is this: ""Identity Theft Red Flags and Address Discrepancies under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003"" (FACT). It amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The rule was written specifically for companies making loans, such as banks and commercial lending institutions, but a portion of it extends to rental property owners and managers since both rely on consumer reports (e.g. credit) that (1) ask for sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and (2) could turn up address discrepancies. The philosophy behind this rule is simple: sensitive information must be kept secure to prevent identity theft, and a discrepancy in address could indicate fraud.</p><p>The rule requires that ""reasonable"" policies be in place to prevent identity theft and to verify a person's identity when an address discrepancy is reported. In the case of address discrepancy, if the property manager can't work out the discrepancy, the rule says he/she is not to rent to this individual.</p><h2>What the Red Flags Rule Means for Rental Owners &amp; Property Managers</h2><p>While the rule has caused some confusion, compliance is straightforward. More than likely, you're probably already in compliance since the only thing that rental owners or property managers have to show is that they have a ""reasonable"" process in place for preventing identity theft and for checking IDs, verifying IDs, and following up/asking about any discrepancies.</p><p>For example, how do you destroy electronic and paper records that contain sensitive information? Or how about this: if someone gives one address on his or her rental application, but the license lists another address, what's your policy for handling this situation? As long as you have reasonable policies in place, you're in compliance.</p><h2>Do I need to create a special report if I suspect fraud?</h2><p>The other commonly asked question about the Red Flags rule (beyond ""how do I comply"") is this: do we need to report suspected fraud? The answer - for better or worse - is no. If you believe someone is trying to perpetrate a fraud, there's no requirement beyond not renting to this individual.</p><h2>Still Unsure About the Red Flags Rule? Contact Your Screening Partner</h2><p>Laws, rules, and amendments result in legitimate questions and concerns, so we understand people's trepidation regarding the Red Flags rule. While it's true that you're likely already in compliance, it can't hurt to contact your screening partner and ask to review with them your policies and systems.</p><p>For full details, visit the FTC website at <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule</a></p><p>The information in this article should not be construed as legal advice.

Is  it  true  that  community  owners  with  existing  pools  will  now  have  to  buy  pool  lifts  or  construct accessible stairs into the pool?  If so, it will be a huge expense for many park owners.</p> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The Americans with Disability Act, or ""ADA""deals with  accommodations in two major  sectors,  public  (Title  II)  and  private  (Title  III).    The  public  sector  covers  state  and  local  governmental  facilities  and  the  private  sector  deals  with  private  entities  that  ""own,  operate,  and  lease"" places  of  public  accommodation,  such  as  restaurants,  hotels,  theaters,  convention  centers,  retail  stores,  shopping  malls,  dry  cleaners,  laundromats,  pharmacies,  doctors'  offices,  hospitals,  museums,  libraries,  parks,  zoos,  amusement  parks,  private  schools,  day  care  centers,  health spa and bowling alleys.</p> <p>On  September  15,  2010,  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ),  who  enforces  the  ADA,  issued  revised  regulations  for  Titles  II  and  III.     Among  other  things,  the  new  regulations  include  new  accessibility  standards  for  swimming  pools.    Existing  swimming  pools  must  be  modified  to  comply  with  the 2010  guidelines  no  later  than March  12,  2012.   For  new construction,  the  2010  guidelines must be followed on a going forward basis.    Included  in  these  guidelines  are  swimming  pool  accessibility  requirements.  They  provide  that  any swimming pool with less than 300 linear feet of pool wall must provide one means of access  either  by  sloped  entry  or  by  the  installation  of  a  pool  lift.</p> <p>Any  pool  that  has  more  than  300  linear  feet  of  pool  wall  must  provide  two  means  of  access,  which  can  be  any  of  five  designated  means  of  access:    (1)  pool  lifts,  (2)  sloped  entries,  (3)  transfer  walls,  (4)  transfer  systems,  or  (5)  accessible pool stairs.    Having said this, it is clear that private manufactured housing communities are  neither public or  private  facilities that  offer  ""public accommodations""under the  ADA  "" at least  insofar  as they do  not open their pool and recreational facilities to the general public.</p> <p>However, two words of warning:</p><ol> <li>While  the  ADA  does  not  strictly  cover  private  residential  facilities  such  as  apartments,  homes  and  manufactured  housing  communities,  if  a  park  resident  provides  child  day  care  services  open  to  the  public  in  his  or  her  private  residence,  those  portions  of  the  residence  used  for  that  purpose  are  subject  to  ADA's  requirements.    So,  community  owners  and  managers  should  be  aware  if  any  of  their  residents  are  operating  such  services,  as  ADA  accessibility,  including  the  pool  area,  may  be  subject  to  ADA  requirements,  to  the  extent  that  the  resident  makes the park facilities available for use by the children.</li><li>The  Fair  Housing  Act,  which  is  administered  by  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (""HUD""),  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  handicap.    To  that  extent,  landlords  arerequired  to  make  ""reasonable  accommodations"" if  requested  by  their  handicapped  residents.   To  some extent, this could  apply  to  a pool or  other  recreational  facilities.   The  body of  law  as  to  what  constitutes  a  ""reasonable  accommodation"" is  far  too  voluminous to  address here.    Suffice  it  to  say,  however,  that  a  landlord  is  not  required  to  make  such  an  accommodation  (e.g.  retrofitting  the  community's  existing  swimming  pool)  if  the  cost  would  impose  an  undue  financial burden.</li> </ol> <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS Q &amp; A SERVICE THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED AS A BENEFIT FOR OUR MEMBERS.

About 60-70  MHCO members showed up supporting community owners  - the residents had about 10 people and could only muster five people to testify publicly in favor to the legislation.   Six people testified on MHCO's behalf with several more waiting in the wings if needed.  There were enough community owners to require an overflow hearing room.  Much of the resident testimony was directed at increasing taxes on their homes.  One Legislator suggested that the residents direct their complaints to the appropriate government taxing authorities and not community owners. Overall is was a good day for community owners - excellent testimony and information.   This was a good  opportunity to continue to educate Oregon Legislators.  MHCO's panel of six individuals representing a diverse section of the industry did an excellent job.MHCO confirmed at the end of the day that this legislation is dead and will not move beyond the public hearing.  We all know these issues do not go away - look for this issue and may other rent control schemes to come up again in the future.  Until the next full legislative session - 2013 - this issue is done.Thanks to those who testified on behalf of MHCO and those who were in attendance and where prepared to testify: Mike Wells, Gary Griglak, Richard Delaney, Kim Berry, Larry Engelgau, Dale Strom, Peter Schraner, Cory Poole, Robert Danielson and Troy Brost.Deep appreciation to those took the time to attend the hearing - your presence was noted.And a final note of thanks to all of you who sent e-mails.  Early yesterday morning I was talking to the chief of staff of one of the Legislators on  the committee and she commented that she was glad we finally reach the day of the rent control hearing - she was hoping it would be the end of all the rent control e-mails!  So thanks to all of you who made your presence known through e-mail.  Many thanks!We are now in the final stretch of the 2011 Legislative Session.

Here is a checklist of general issues you may wish to consider:</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Confidentiality always concerns me.</strong>&nbsp; Why does the company want it?&nbsp; I suspect they don't want parks ""comparing notes""on the deal they cut with their company.&nbsp; While that is understandable, it poses the risk of inadvertent disclosure.&nbsp; What is the ""penalty""for disclosure?&nbsp; Do you have to refund the initial payment made?&nbsp; If so, does that mean the deal is over, or does the remainder of the agreement survive  -  that is, does the company still have the exclusive right to provide services in the park?&nbsp; I think I would like to see some language which penalized only intentional or willful disclosures (assuming you have any ability at all to negotiate some of these terms).</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>I assume the company will own all of the equipment.</strong>&nbsp; Are there certain limitations on their ability to come and go inside the park?&nbsp; Specifically, is there a risk of noise, inconvenience, traffic issues, etc?&nbsp; How long will installation take?&nbsp; Will the park grounds be restored to their original condition?&nbsp; Again, remember, once these agreements are signed, you're at the company's mercy on what they do.&nbsp; Make sure their reputation for service and cooperation is good.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>What is the term of the agreement?</strong> I suspect it contains a provision for automatic renewal, absent one party or the other giving notice of termination?&nbsp; While that is fair, you have to carefully read the agreements to see if there is any right to terminate without cause.&nbsp; In other words, can you get out of the deal ""just because,""or does there have to be a breach?&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>If either side terminates does the initial payment have to be returned to the company?</strong>&nbsp; If so, you might consider making that payment ""nonrefundable""after a certain length of time, say five years.&nbsp; You want to make sure that if the agreements become unenforceable due to some law or similar situation over which you have no control, that you do not have to refund the money.&nbsp; That is why I suggest a period of years, after which the money becomes refundable.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Recording of any agreement is significant.</strong>&nbsp; Once recorded, it will act as a sort of restrictive covenant on the land, and will continue <em>ad infinitum.&nbsp; </em>In your case, I suspect that the recorded agreement will act as a sort of ""floating""easement, giving the company general rights of ingress and egress to install, maintain and repair the equipment.&nbsp; If the easement rights are not specifically defined, you may want to make sure you understand, in advance, where the equipment will be located.&nbsp; You want to make sure there will be no risk that the company's right of access interferes with the residents' spaces.&nbsp; It's easy to record such agreements on the public record, but much more difficult to remove them in the event of a dispute.&nbsp; Do either of your agreements address that issue?&nbsp; If you part ways with the company, are they obligated to remove their easement rights from the public record (e.g. by a recorded notice of abandonment of their rights under the agreement)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you have to pay any costs to have this done?</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li>You want to make sure that if the agreement is terminated the equipment must be removed promptly and the land returned to its general pre-installation condition.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>What about liability?</strong>&nbsp; It is not uncommon for these agreements to have cross indemnification provisions, whereby you agree to indemnify them for your negligence, and they do the same.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Are there limitations on damages in the agreement?</strong> &nbsp;Most companies attempt to place limits on the kinds of damages that may be recovered (e.g. prohibitions on punitive damages).&nbsp; Generally, that is fine, but just make sure that these limits apply just to park ownership, as you cannot limit the residents' right <em>vis a vis</em> the cable company.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>If the company has an exclusive right to market its services to the residents, you want to make sure you know what their marketing efforts will consist of.</strong>&nbsp; You want to make sure it will not include personal solicitation to residents.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Check with other parks to find out whether they have similar agreements.</strong>&nbsp; I acknowledge that they may not talk about it due to the confidentiality provisions, but suspect the agreement that may be recorded is not ""confidential. -""&nbsp; Your main concern should be whether other park owners are satisfied with this particular company.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>Before jumping into anything, find out if there are competing companies that may have similar programs. </strong></li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>How will you deal with residents if they ask you whether you received any payment for giving the company its exclusive rights?</strong>&nbsp; The best response might be that your practice is not to discuss the park's financial arrangement with vendors.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you should expect someone might press the issue.</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>How will the exclusivity provisions in the agreement affect a resident's right to have satellite service?</strong>&nbsp; Does the agreement deal with the possibility that satellite providers may want to market in the park?&nbsp; You may have some difficulty in preventing a resident from signing up for such service, so this issue should be addressed with the cable company ahead of time.&nbsp;

According to the  2007 period life table for the Social Security area population,  those on the cusp of retirement, ages 55 -""64, are expected to  live on average 21.34 more years.  Living in a manufactured  home community represents an ideal lifestyle choice for many  in this demographic.  The following represents some real  advantages that manufactured homes offer the 55+ market:    ""Manufactured homes can be customized to fit the  needs and wants of every homebuyer.  This includes  interior floor plans, exterior designs and custom  kitchens, baths and living areas.  ""Manufactured housing, especially those located in  land -""lease communities, are less expensive to  purchase and maintain.  ""Manufactured homes offer convenient one -""story  living and can be built for accessibility.  "" Manufactured home communities provide a unique  setting where smaller yards require less maintenance,  while individual home sites maximize privacy.   ""Manufactured home communities provide a secure,  friendly, relaxed environment with a strong sense of   - Öcommunity'.    How can manufactured housing communities benefit 55+?    Manufactured housing communities allow residents to own  their own home while leasing the land, thus eliminating the  expense of property taxes and allowing homeowners to enjoy  amenities and well -""maintained common areas.  According to  a report prepared for the Commission of Affordable Housing  and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century,  advantages of land -""lease properties are that ""the resident can  own the home with a lower down -""payment than virtually any  other housing alternative because the cost of land is not  included in the transaction. The resident can also benefit from  appreciation, provided the home is well maintained in a well""located and maintained park.""   In addition, and no less important, is the sense of community  engendered by the manufactured home lifestyle.   By  providing many opportunities for social interaction through  organized activities, such as clubs, fitness classes and social  events, communities encourage resident relationships.     Safety and security are top concerns for many residents.   Many 55+ communities are gated and provide on -""site security  as well as neighborhood watch programs.  By providing a  sense of security,  spaces to personalize, interesting  destinations and places to walk, and the options of having  pets, manufactured home communities have the potential of  encouraging active living for 55+ individuals.    What can community owners offer to attract the 55+ market?   Age restricted manufactured housing communities,  typically  called 55+, offer many advantages with many different types  of land -""lease communities to choose from.  They can be large  communities with numerous amenities or smaller and more  affordable family -""owned communities.  There are  communities located all over the country and in every price  range.  Common amenities include swimming pools,  clubhouses, health clubs, and tennis courts.    We know that most people begin their housing search online.   To capture the attention of those  looking online at housing  options, 55+ manufactured home communities need to have  attractive websites that provide lots of information, including  pictures of the community (not just individual homes),  information about lease fees, and testimonials from  homeowners.   In addition, an attractive and informative  website should highlight those services and amenities that are  important and attractive to seniors.  Jensen Communities  (www.jensencommunities.com), offers a great example of a  website that is user -""friendly. In addition to outlining  important information related to the advantages of living in a  manufactured home, the website provides prospective residents with a comprehensive list of special amenities found  in their communities.    Jim Ayotte, Executive Director of the  Florida Manufactured Housing Association, states,  ""to make  an emotional connection with prospective homebuyers, every  community's website should have a detailed description of  their value proposition, with quality pictures of homes and  individuals.  Homeowner testimonials are a great idea.""   With over 900 55+ manufactured home communities, Florida  represents a top destination choice for many.  In Mr. Ayotte's  view, the range of options available in Florida's 55+  communities is limitless.   Those in the 55+ market are  undoubtedly attracted to Florida's warm climate, sandy  beaches, suburban or rural settings (depending on  preferences), excellent health care and affordable cost of  living.  Many of Florida's 55+ manufactured housing  communities have swimming pools, community centers,  health clubs, tennis courts and executive or professional golf  courses.  Seniors are looking not just to buy a home but to buy  into a lifestyle.  Ayotte also explained that he expects the 55+  community industry to expand over the next ten years as the  baby -""boomer generation reaches  retirement age.  Experts  have indicated that baby -""boomers are very active and many  are expected to continue working after they retire.  Community owners that focus on the 55+ market need to be  poised to meet the unique needs of this large demographic.    Manufactured home communities continue to be a popular  option for a growing segment of the aging U.S. baby boomer  generation.  In the last decade, the median age of the nation  has increased from 35.3 to 37.2  -  an all -""time high as  determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.  In 2010, 17.3 percent  of Florida's population was age 65 or higher.  This trend is  expected to continue as more seniors flock to Florida and  other warm weather retirement destinations.  For seniors, 55+ manufactured home communities provide an affordable  housing choice with great lifestyle advantages.  Clearly, this  niche market is a great opportunity for seniors and  community owners alike.

The resident gave a 30-day notice earlier in the month.  Rent was paid to the 10th day of the following month. The resident left the home, taking his belongings, but claims he will be back to clean the home up and collect his $400 cleaning deposit.  However, the electric company is coming out to shut off the power because the resident owes them for unpaid bills.  The landlord is concerned about the pipes freezing, since the local temperatures at night drops into the low 20s.  What are the landlord's rights as far as entering the home?  Specifically, what can the landlord do to save the pipes?  Can the landlord have the electric bill changed to his/her name, enter the property and turn on the heat and power and then turn it off during the day?  Where is this covered in the Oregon Revised Statutes?  Can the landlord apply the $400 toward funds advance toward the electric bill?Answer:  Under this scenario, the landlord is also the owner of the home, so under certain circumstances, access would be permitted.  Under the manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law, where the tenant owns the home, I would say that the only right of access  -  even in an emergency  -  is to the space itself and not the interior of the home.  It would only be following the landlord's declaration of an abandonment under ORS 90.675, that he/she would have a right to enter the home itself.  Until that right arises, I would probably advise the landlord to stay out of the tenant's home under almost any circumstances, since there is no provision under the manufactured housing side of the law that permits such entry where the tenant owns the home.In our present case, the landlord also owns the home, so his/her rights are the same as any other landlord of an apartment or other rental unit.  A landlord's right of access where the landlord owns the home, would be found in ORS 90.322  90.322(1)(b) deals with emergency access:In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant's absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered. [Underscore added. - PCQ] As for the application of the security deposit, I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than simply applying it toward monies expended to keep the electricity on.  Your question called it a ""cleaning deposit."" If that is how it was designated, it suggests that it may be applied only toward cleaning of the home.  The better term to use in the rental agreement is ""security deposit""which is designed to ""secure the tenant's performance under the rental agreement."" If the rental agreement required that the tenant keep all such utility charges current, then the breach of that provision would entitle the landlord to apply the deposit toward the expenditure of funds to remedy the breach. The security deposit statute is ORS 90.300, and is helpful to read, as it addresses the landlord's duty to account to the tenant for the expenditure of funds within 31 days following termination of the tenancy, or the tenant's departure, if later than the termination.",839,1,1315848593,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0142,13335,community_updates,und,Medical Marijuana and Landlord Rights,"Question: Our community is seeing an increase in the use of ""medical""marijuana.  Although those using it say they have ""cards""permitting them to grow limited amounts, often this limited personal use appears to turn into more than that.  We are noticing increasing late night traffic at some users' homes, and believe they are expanding their grow operations in order to sell the marijuana to unauthorized users. What can be done about this?  It is quite disruptive to the rest of our community.Answer: A good discussion and summary of Oregon's medical marijuana law is found at the following link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/medicalmarijuanaprogram/Pages/index.aspx  The Oregon statutes are located at this link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/statutes.pdfHere are the Oregon administrative rules:http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/rules.pdf As you can no doubt see, these laws and rules are focused primarily on legal marijuana use, rather than illegal use.  Although Oregon's landlord-tenant law has a statute giving a landlord the right to issue a 24-hour notice to residents engaged in the manufacture, delivery or possession of controlled substances, it does not include ""The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475.300 to 475.346. -""In order to evict the offending resident(s), the difficulty is trying to prove that the resident is actually manufacturing, deliverying, or possessing marijuana in violation of the law.  This is particularly tough since the landlord cannot gain access to the interior of the home or the backyard. (If the backyard is concealed by a high fence, I would probably not advise a landlord to take pictures or view the area by using a ladder or other similar means.  Leave that for the police.All in all, I have three suggestions: (a) Go the police and see if you can enlist their help in stopping this activity; (b) Find out how to start a neighborhood watch program that will discourage persons driving in to buy drugs; (c) Carefully and patiently begin tracking neighbor complaints of late night activity that causes a disturbance to the other neighbors.  Begin by first contacting the offending resident by phone or a personal visit, politely asking that the activity cease.  If it continues, write a letter (not a termination notice).  If it continues, then issue a 30-day termination notice for violation of ORS 90.740(3)(i), which requires that tenants ""Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors."" Once this notice is given, if the conduct stops within the 30 days, you may re-issue a second notice with a 20-day non-curable termination if it re-occurs with 6 months following issuance of the first 30-day curable notice.  I prefer this approach, since the landlord is not required to ""prove""that the resident was actually engaging in the manufacture, delivery or possession of marijuana.  All you need to do is establish the circumstances giving rise to the disruption and that it is interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of the other residents.  The judge or jury will be able to ""connect the dots.""

Can she do that and if so, what kind of notice should she give?  Also, can she change the late fee from a flat amount to a percentage (e.g. 10%) of rent?Answer:  Here is a summary of ORS 90.260, the late fee statute.  It answers the questions posed above.(1)	 A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if: - ¢	The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and - ¢	There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:o	The tenant's obligation to pay a late charge;o	The type and amount of the late charge; ando	The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due.(2)	The amount of any late charge may not exceed: - ¢	A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. ""Reasonable amount""means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market; - ¢	A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the ""reasonable lat amount -"", described above; or - ¢	Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only.(3)	In periodic tenancies (e.g. month-to-month), a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days' written notice to the tenant.(4)	A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.(5)	A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.(6)	Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination.  [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge  on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]",839,1,1318260777,1402693692,1,0,0,0,0179,13365,community_updates,und,Landlord Requirements to have licensed plumber or electtrician,"Question:  A landlord recently purchased a manufactured home in his community.

Management did not change the rules and regulations.  However, they did advertise the community as ""55&Older -""; identified that status in the community's Application Criteria; and have met the requirements of the ""80/20 Rule"".  Now the community owner is changing the rules. One of the many rule change includes altering the status of the community from ""Family"" to ""55 & Older"".  It is likely that the residents will have enough votes in the petition to vote down the rule changes.  Where does this leave the community's ""55 & Older Status""?  Does that status actually need to be in the rules?Answer: I believe the rule change is essential.  The reason is that it is the primary document (along with the rental agreement) that defines how the park is to operate under a 55+ regime.   Here is a brief summary of how these conversions should occur:Currently, in order to qualify for the 55+ exemption under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1989 (""FHAA -"") and the Housing for Older Persons Act (""HIPA -"") of 1999, a community must comply with the following requirements:1.	Be intended and operated for persons age 55 or over.  This intent can be met by such things as (1) The manner in which the community is described to prospective residents; (2) Advertising designed to attract prospective residents; (3) Lease or rental provisions; (4) The written rules and regulations; (5) Consistent application of the rules, regulations and procedures; (6) Actual practices; and (7) Publicly posting statements describing the facility as a 55+ community.   The age verification procedures must be updated every two years.  This means maintaining a complete file on each space, including with the tenant application updated information, circulated every two years, confirming the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home.2.	 Have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical.   Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that the 20% margin must be reserved for families with children?  The answer is ""No."" In fact, a 55+ community may strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age or older?  Again, the answer is ""No."" If desired, the community may increase the age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.   Similarly, the community may impose a more restrictive minimum age requirement than 55.  However, it is important for park owners and managers to make sure that all such age/occupancy requirements be properly reflected in the community's Rules and the Statement of Policy  -  and be consistently applied.   3.	Publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be operated as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory.  The community must make sure that in all that it does, from its advertising, rules, rental agreements, and all other policies, it always hold itself out as a 55+ facility.   4.	Comply with HUD age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that 80% of the facility be intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver's license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.  Today, if the community can meet the HOPA requirements in all respects (not because it discriminated in getting there, but simply by attrition of family occupants and the influx of more 55+ residents), it should be permitted to do so.  The process would be fairly simple for those communities that exceed the minimum 80% floor (i.e. at least one occupant age 55 or over):  Implement a rules change to conform with the 55+ laws, combined with new published policies and age verification procedures, which confirm the community's 55+ status.  One caveat:  Even though the Oregon landlord-tenant law does permit rules changes to implement material modifications in the parties' bargain, there is a risk of possible argument by families in the community, complaining that they are now limited in the pool of available buyers for their homes.  However, this risk can be remedied by ""grandfathering""those family residents in, thereby permitting them to sell their homes to other families.  This assumes, of course, that by doing so, the community would not jeopardize its 80%-20% ratio.  Before proceeding down this path, park owners are urged to contact their own legal counsel familiar with the FFHA and HOPA for advice and direction.",839,1,1321894387,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0205,13391,community_updates,und,Resident Pays After FED Issued Settles Before Hearing,"<p>Question:  We have had to file two consecutive FED Complaints against a resident.  The day before the first appearance for each case, the resident tender the rent that was due, although he do not pay the court fees of $115.00.  After two months of this, he owes us $230.00.  He promises to repay this amount but does not.  Now rent is due for January, 2012.  We are sure the same thing will happen again. How can we collect the court fees?</p><p>Answer:  I assume that when he tenders the rent, you accept it and report to the court that the case is to be dismissed.  This means that any leverage you had to make the full payment, including court fees, has disappeared.  You might consider one of the two following alternatives:</p><p>1.	Since the 72 hours has already expired and you've had to file the FED complaint, you are not required to accept the rent unless he agrees to pay the court fees.  Next time, if he declines, don't let the case be dismissed.  Go to the regularly scheduled first appearance.  If he shows up, tell the judge you'd gladly permit him to stay if he pays the filing fees.  If he can't afford to pay it in one lump sum, negotiate a repayment plan (e.g. 50% next month and 50% the following month).  Then have the judge put the agreement in a Stipulated Judgment of Restitution, which means that if he doesn't pay the sums do as scheduled, you can go back to court to have him evicted.</p><p>2.	Under Oregon's ""three strikes""law [ORS 90.630(8)-(10)], if a resident is issued three 72-hour notices within a rolling 12 month period, you can issue them a 30-day non-curable eviction notice, on or shortly after, the third strike.  Then you can say to the resident that you will permit them to stay only on condition of payment of the outstanding court fees.  Obviously, this is a pretty big hammer and if they can't pay the fees all at once, you should negotiate partial payments, similar to what I suggested above.  However, this alternative would automatically not result in a ""Stipulated Judgment of Restitution""(you would have to be in court to get that).  For that reason, I prefer No. 1 over No. 2.</p>",839,1,1325630896,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0207,13393,community_updates,und,Abandonment and Resident Destruction of Home,"<p><strong>Question: </strong> A resident living alone passed away.  It took some time for the estate to get underway because they had to search for heirs.  An heir was located and was appointed as Administrator to act on behalf of the estate.    Shortly after the resident's passing, we began requesting that a Storage Agreement be signed but the estate was hesitant to do so until the Administrator was appointed.  After the appointment the Administrator was initially cooperative, but unexpectedly changed his mind and is now threatening to bring all of the past due rent current, and then, out of spite, tear the home down while still on the space.  Presumably, after doing so, we would expect the Administrator to cease all further space rental payments.  How should we handle this?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong> This sounds like an episode from a Jerry Springer reality show!  Your question doesn't make it clear whether the estate was formally filed for probate in court, in which case this ""Administrator""would be subject to court supervision and would have to have a bond.  I'm suspecting that is not the case  -  but if it is, you may want to secure legal counsel to notify the court of what's happening and perhaps get him removed.</p><p>Assuming that the person is just a designee for the un-probated estate (I will call him the ""representative -""), I would suggest that you look to ORS 90.675(20), which applies when a resident living alone passes away.  Subsection (20) is summarized below, but should not be used as a substitute for reading ORS 90.675 (linked here) in its entirety:</p><p> - ¢	This subsection (20) applies the same duties as those of a resident who abandoned the property.</p><p> - ¢	It also applies to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court, or any person designated in writing by the decedent to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death;</p><p> - ¢	The 45-day abandonment notice required in ORS 90.675(3) (go to above link) is to be sent by first class mail to this representative at the premises, and also personally delivered or sent by first class mail to them if actually known to the landlord.</p><p> - ¢	If the representative responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided in the letter and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later.</p><p> - ¢	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Entering into the storage agreement includes the duty to pay a ""storage fee""which can be no higher than the space rent. This duty is not triggered until the 45-day letter is sent.  Presumably you will use a good storage agreement that requires, among other things, compliance with all applicable park rules and state, federal and local laws and ordinances, including a duty to maintain the space.  On- site destruction of the home is NOT maintaining the space.  Depending upon the home's age, on site destruction could be a violation of certain environmental laws, due to potentially hazardous material used in construction.  In fact, since there is a risk that the representative will not comply with the storage agreement  -  based on his threat of destruction - you may want to consider  -  only upon the advice of your attorney  -  to restrict his unsupervised access to the home.  Destruction of the home would not only take it off the tax rolls in violation of Oregon property tax law, but it would prevent you, as the landlord, from selling the home upon failure of the representative to meet his obligations.  Remember, in addition to the tax collector, you have a vested interest in seeing the home sold for recoupment any sums due (arguably including attorney fees) incurred during the abandonment process.</em></p><p> - ¢	Since the abandonment law requires that the landlord has a duty of safe keeping pending completion of the abandonment process, it is my belief  that this entitles the landlord to secure the home (e.g. with a new lock) so that heirs and others cannot enter and remove personal property.</p><p> - ¢	A storage agreement entitles the representative to store the personal property on the space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</p><p> - ¢	If such an agreement is entered into, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder (if any) until the agreement with the representative ends.</p><p> - ¢	If the representative requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement and there is a lienholder, also, you should review subsections (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of ORS 90.675, which describes the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</p><p> - ¢	During the term of the Storage Agreement, the representative has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir who wishes to leave the property on the space and become a tenant.  However, this prospective tenant is subject to the same statutory requirement, including landlord qualification and approval, as found in ORS 90.680 (linked here). The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</p><p> - ¢	If the representative violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it by giving at least 30 days' written notice to them stating facts sufficient to notify them of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the Storage Agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the representative.</p><p> - ¢	Upon the failure of a representative to enter into a storage agreement or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of it pursuant to sale provisions of ORS 90.675 without further notice to the representative.</p><p>So, in summary, the abandonment statute  -  which is quite lengthy and somewhat difficult to follow  -  applies in this case, and with proper guidance, you should be able to successfully deal with the representative.</p>",839,1,1326837906,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0212,13396,community_updates,und,Rent to Own and SAFE Act Implications,"<p>Question:  We just acquired a manufactured home in our community.

A Summary of Pets in Your Community Rights and Responsibilites,"<p>One of the most challenging issues facing park owners and managers is the issue of pets.

How can owners and managers take control of the issue?</p><p>First, landlords should check their current rules and rental agreement. Although landlords who have previously permitted pets in the community, cannot retroactively prohibit them to tenants who already have pets living with them. Nor can they retroactively prohibit a type of pet that had previously been permitted. However, going forward, i.e. for new tenants, landlords should make sure that their rules place appropriate limitations on the size and type of pets that can be brought into the park. Rules should be drafted broadly to prohibit pets, e.g. breeds of dogs, that have a reputation for aggressiveness, or dogs of a particular size, or both.</p><p>Secondly, consistency is important. That is, landlords should be careful not to make exceptions or ignore violations of the pet rules. Otherwise, the landlord will be accused of either being arbitrary or ""playing favorites."" Selective prosecution of tenants for violation of the pet rules does not play well with judges and juries.</p><p>Lastly, in all cases, landlords should make sure that their tenants sign pet agreements for their animals. Oregon law expressly permits this. The MHCO agreement (Form 21)  follows the statutory guidelines and assures that the tenant has liability insurance coverage. It also permits landlords to assess fines for violations of the rules.</p>",839,1,1343766297,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0243,13426,community_updates,und,Beyond The SAFE ACT with Blackhawk Capital Group,"<p>By Kris Monte - President Blackhawk Capital Group</p><p><strong>E-mail: kmonte@bhcapitalgroup.com</strong></p><p>The SAFE Act has received a lot of attention lately by park owners, but did you know that it's really only one law of many state and federal lending regulations you are required to comply with when selling homes on contract?</p><p>The SAFE Act requires you, the park owner, to either use a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator such as Blackhawk Capital Group or obtain your own origination licensing in order to sell your park homes on installment contracts.

The dealer then sold the home to another person who applied for tenancy and passed the screening criteria.  The landlord wants the past due rent ($900) paid before permitting applicant to move into the home.  Can the landlord go after the dealer to pay the past due rent?  Can the landlord keep the applicant from moving in until the $900 is paid?  Should the landlord have given some notice to the existing tenant, the dealer, and/or the prospective tenant, regarding how the unpaid rent should be handled?  What about other expenses the tenant who sold the home ran up, such as utilities, late fees, maintenance clean up expenses, etc.?  What do you suggest as far as notices to the dealer stating the amount of money owed?  The dealer is not the lien holder.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Landlords should become intimately familiar with ORS 90.680, and then make sure their rules and rental agreements conform to what is allowed.  Set forth below is a summary of those portions of the statute that address your questions:</p><p>o	If the prospective purchaser of a manufactured dwelling or floating home desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, the landlord may require the following:</p><p>o	That a tenant give not more than 10 days' notice in writing prior to the sale of the dwelling or home on a rented space;</p><p>o	That prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized;</p><p>o	That a prospective purchaser may not occupy the dwelling or home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;</p><p>o	That a tenant give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell dwellings or homes of the requirements of the resale requirements [Emphasis mine - PCQ];</p><p>o	If the sale is not by a lienholder, that the prospective purchaser pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant [Emphasis mine];</p><p>o	If the landlord's rules and/or rental agreement requires prospective purchasers to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale ;</p><p>o	The following conditions apply if a landlord receives an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser:</p><p>o	 The landlord shall accept or reject the prospective purchaser's application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application ;</p><p>o	An application is not complete until the prospective purchaser pays any required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required by the landlord;</p><p>o	The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>o	Failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlord's conditions for approval;</p><p>o	Failure of the prospective purchaser's references to respond to the landlord's timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection;</p><p>o	In most cases, the landlord must furnish to the seller and purchaser a written statement of the reasons for any rejection ;</p><p>o	The landlord may give the tenant selling the home a notice to repair the home [e.g. for damage or deterioration] under ORS 90.632. The landlord may also give any prospective purchaser a copy of that notice.</p><p>o	The landlord may require as a condition of tenancy that a prospective purchaser who desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant must comply with the repair notice within the allowed period under ORS 90.632.</p><p>o	If the tenancy has been terminated for failure to timely complete the repairs under ORS 90.632, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.</p><p>Obviously, the statute was drafted with tenant/purchasers in mind.  However, as long as the home remains on the space, the landlord has complete control over the situation.  In your case, I suspect the delinquent tenant made no effort to notify the landlord of his planned sale to the dealer.  However, that does not prevent him from imposing these requirements on the dealer if he wants to put a tenant in the park.</p><p>Going forward, it might be advisable for all landlords who have faced this situation before, to prepare a summary of requirements to give dealers when they purchase homes from tenants already sited in the park.  They may want to expressly address this in their rules, so tenants cannot say they didn't know.  The written summary to dealers should clearly state that if a departing tenant owes monies to the landlord, repayment will be required before occupancy of the home will be permitted by a new resident.  [<em>A more difficult question that is not addressed by the statute, ORS 90.680, is whether the landlord may prevent the dealer from removing the home without paying the past due sums.

The former resident and owner of the home without notice to the landlord sells the ""abandoned"" home to another person.   Does the landlord have to send a new abandonment notice to the new owner and restart the 60 day clock?  Answer: [Note: This answer presumes that the landlord has legally declared the abandonment, and following the statute regarding issuance of the 45-day letter. It also presumes that there are no liens on the home, since they would have prior right to determine what happens.]  Interestingly, I find nothing in the abandonment statute [ORS 90.675] that prohibits the tenant from selling the home during the 45-day period following the landlord's issuance of the 45-day letter.  In fact, I believe that possibility was contemplated when the statute was drafted and/or amended.  [My answer might be different if the tenant sold the home after expiration of the 45-day letter, since the statute says that under that circumstance the home is conclusively presumed"" to be abandoned.  To me this means that the tenant had nothing to convey.

We informed the son's father that he would have to leave due to his conviction.  He did leave but now he is doing odd jobs here in the park. He also comes into the park to visit his family.  We are getting resident complaints because people are still concerned for their children. Is there anything I can do as a manager to keep this man out of our community? Answer:  Your question raises several issues worthy of discussion. First, the fact that the son is in the park and you didn't know he was a convicted sex offender, tells me that the park should beef up its rules to require all persons 18 years and over undergo a criminal background check. If the son is on parole, you may want to try to contact his parole officer.  I fully suspect that there may be conditions of his parole that may apply to keep him out of the park.

Done properly and effectively, the rental application and screening process will minimize potential problems in landlord - resident relations.  If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.  Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.  When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, always give them an application packet.  Anyone who is interested in applying should be given the application packet - inconsistency in giving out application packets could lead to claims by the resident selling the home, or a fair housing violation.

If the prospective resident insists that you process the application then do so.  However, in general, be very careful about rendering, in advance, any opinions about acceptance or rejection, since it could be used against you as evidence of discrimination if the applicant is the member of a protected class.

Give the landlord a written 10-day notice of their intent to sell their manufactured home.  (Note: The 10 days will run parallel with the 7 day application process - i.e. if the resident notifies the landlord of intent to sell the home and does not give the 10 day notice, then the application process time to approve or reject can take nor more 10 days - rather than 7 days.  If you want more time, insert the longer time on the MHCO Application form and have the prospective resident sign it.)2.	The existing resident must advise the prospective purchaser that they have to fill out an application with the landlord and be approved.3.	Do not move anyone into the manufactured home that has not been approved through the tenant screening and approval process and signed all necessary documents, including the rental agreement.If you are aware of a sale and do not have the purchaser fill out an application, or fail to advise the seller and prospective purchaser in writing that the application has been rejected within the applicable period of time (seven days, tens days or longer, as discussed above) after they fill out the application, then the purchaser can move into the mobile home under the same condition of the rental agreement of the seller.  Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the current resident who is the seller of the manufactured home.If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.  If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.  You have no contract with them and you can request them to remove the home from the park.

Kathleen brings over 20 years of accounting experience and knowledge to the Commonwealth team, and as a multi-site property owner herself, understands the unique needs facing property investors and small business owners. ### So before I give you another accounting rule we are enforcing, let me say the goal is to protect your investment! We live in a very litigious society and need to be aware of potential risks and ways to protect our assets. Commonwealth employees are insured through workers' compensation policies and also provided regular training regarding workplace safety. Another area we are striving to improve risk management and compliance is in the area of hiring contractors. When a contractor is hired, the onsite manager must obtain verification that the contractor is licensed, bonded, and insured. In addition, a Form W-9 must be provided for purposes of reporting non-employee compensation on a Form 1099-Misc at the end of the year. The downturn in the economy resulted in many contractors allowing their insurance and licensing to lapse. We are currently working on two projects to confirm all contractors are still in compliance. The first will be a ""preferred vendor"" list by location. Commonwealth is compiling lists by geographic areas of approved vendors so in an emergency situation your onsite manager or regional manager knows what vendors have up-to-date information on file. Secondly, we will be combining this vendor list with our accounting program to alert us when we need to update the insurance information. The reason to remind our customers of this policy is that some may have ""tried and true"" contractors that would not be eligible to work at the communities unless they can provide the necessary information requested OR become an employee to complete the task you wish to hire them for. I mention the latter as it is a legal remedy to tackling some of the small jobs that may be better served by hiring specialized temporary employees through agencies. Another option is hiring an individual on a task by task basis for their special skill. Commonwealth wants to be sure we are doing our best to protect your investment by limiting your risk exposure, both legal and financial, associated with contractors working at your communities. Another reminder is that we do send 1099-Misc forms to all contractors annually. The form 1099-Misc reports all non-employee compensation. Amounts paid for employee compensation are reported on a Form W-2. Employees cannot receive a 1099-Misc and Form W-2 from the same employer for similar work. In order to keep away from any proof of control issues, our company policy is to send a W-2 to all employees and make sure all compensation for that individual runs through payroll. All independent contractor payments are reported on a 1099-Misc.</p>",839,0,1376566889,1415055209,1,0,0,0,0406,13566,community_updates,und,Current Lending Climate for Manufactured Home Communities,"<p>By: Rachelle Menaker is a partner with Hart, King &amp; Coldren's transactional practice group. I. INTRODUCTION: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT LENDING CLIMATE FOR MHP'S Everyone knows that interest rates in re- cent years - in the wake of the financial melt- down that occurred in the mid-2008 to mid-2009 timeframe - have been at historic lows. While in the past few quarters of 2013 rates have crept up slightly, interest rates are still favorable from a historical perspective. Clearly, none of us have crystal balls as to how long rates will remain at these relatively attractive rates. So no guarantees on the duration of this favorable market for interest rates can be made.

This doesn't cause quite as much heartburn for property owners who have wisely passed such utilities through to the residents to pay in addition to their rent. However, for the overwhelming majority of properties, particularly those which were developed prior to the 90's, the rent charged typically includes any combination of utilities including water, sewer, garbage, and to a lesser percentage electricity, natural gas, cable television/satellite, and internet services. From one year to the next, the only certainty one can realistically expect is that rents will need to be adjusted just to keep pace with the utility increases that are coming one's way from the various providers. The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs? Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies. We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services. Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year. Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin. This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent. A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense. You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption. This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption. Rates are high now and will continue to rise. A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities. All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility. You need to be aware that your business is under attack. Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges. As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice: 1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment. This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list. The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing. The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees. Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing. The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"". I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity. The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law. Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent. Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"". This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges. One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states. We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another. Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide. Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense. Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board. If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents.

It is not a gimmick, I have done it myself. Adam Cook's MHCO Community Update article, ""Can You Afford to Keep Utilities Included in Your Rent?"" from last week is spot on! My answer is no, I cannot and no longer do"". Both Landlords and Tenants agree of the importance of sub-metering; it is a win-win proposition. Enduring years of Landlord/Tenant Coalition, one of the most daunting tasks was demonstrating Landlords do not have safes' locked full of money. Financing options simply did not exist to fund mandatory sub-metering. Where were Landlords to find upwards of $750+ per homesite to install water sub-meters? Of course, Landlords proved their argument and negotiated the right to unilaterally amend rental agreements to permit community-wide sub-metering; creating provisions to recapture installation expenses by billing Tenants. Considering a new program now available, I believe every Landlord should sub-meter sooner than later! Now available is a sub-meter and installation program at zero expense to any Landlord wanting to install new or replace old sub-meter systems. No applications, no qualifications, and no money down gets you state of the art wireless monitored sub-meters (water, electric, and gas are all available). What's the catch? ... the Landlord signs a 10 year Billing Agreement with the provider, in which the Tenant pays. So, how does it work? First, the meters are purchased/installed/administered/maintained/repaired/monitored/insured/read/etc. by an Independent 3rd party. Just as all meter reading companies, this 3rd party charges a monthly fee for their service ... it is their cost of doing business. In Eugene, this 3rd party charges nearly 1/2 less of what EWEB (Eugene Water and Electric Board) charges it's customers. Second, per ORS 90, the 3rd party bills the Tenant the cost of the sub-meter and installation over a minimum of 60 months. The sub-metering process is complicated; no worries, this 3rd party is experienced, has been in business for nearly a decade, has all the systems and sample notices in place, and handles the entire process on behalf of the Landlord. The Bottom line: local government agencies and utility companies use Landlords to pass through their exorbitant ""fees"" and rate increases, in which Landlords are forced to carry until the next ""rent"" increase ... making the Landlord the greedy bad guy. Prior to sub-metering, utility expenses were 23% of my rent; my monthly invoices now line item sub-meter every utility possible. My rents are now very competitive within the market and I have direct control over costs. I see every reason why all Landlords should do the same. Indeed, it sounds too good to be true ... it is.

HB 4038A fixes those problems.1.Under current law, it is unclear whether and to whom an owner must give notice of the owner's interest in selling the park, or what that notice must say.a.	ORS 90.760 allows an undefined tenants association to give notice to the owner of its interest in buying the park before the owner indicates an interest in selling. Apparently, this notice is good forever, even if the tenants die/move or if there is a different owner. No-one keeps track of these notices.

ORS 90.810 appears to require notice from the owner even if the tenants have not previously notified the owner of their interest in purchasing the park.HB 4038A amends the law to require an owner to give notice to all tenants, without advance registration, or, if there is an active tenant group with which the owner has met during the past 12 months, to that group only, whenever the owner is interested in selling or has received an offer to buy which the owner is considering.

Weber &amp; M. Christine Weber We all know it is far easier to maintain a resident than find one who will fill a vacant space within a community. This is particularly true in 55+ communities. To be great at resident retention, managers need to believe strongly in the lifestyle that has led many seniors to a manufactured housing way of life. Managers must be helpful, respectful, enthusiastic and work relentlessly to continuously improve their seniors' lifestyles. One of the measuring sticks of great managers, as well as great regional managers, is their ability to be friendly while at the same time, keeping their eyes firmly upon the objectives of the community. The responsibilities of property management are immense and sometimes thankless. It is hard to believe that any of us could add another thing to our schedules to strive for better resident relations. But we must, and we must go at it with an eager, devoted, and intense passion to be successful. The only way to achieve this and still maintain the quality of the community is great organizational skills, resident, participation and the initiative to be creative. No matter how large or small a community and its budget, the following simple steps will bring a community to its peak performance and create strong resident relations. Get the Residents Involved Make photo albums or scrapbooks of residents enjoying their community or community activities. Seniors enjoy donating photos from their past and the fun time they've had with neighbors or friends. Residents can form a photography club to take pictures of all community events, funny resident situations and neighbors helping one another. Photo clubs are a good source for pictures submitted by residents. Volunteers can help with the collection of photos and putting together the album. Display the album(s) proudly in the activity center or community lounge area for all to enjoy. Managers should look through the books from time to time to ensure quality content. Encourage residents to write positive letters or stories about the community. Resident writings can be collected in an attractive album, which is also to be displayed in the community activity center. When the letters have been submitted, ask if they may be used in the community newsletter. Pick one letter a month to exhibit in an attractive picture frame under the caption, Letter of the month"" or ""Why we enjoy living in this community."" Create a journal to pass around the community (it may be a spiral notebook) for all residents to write in. A note stating the topic should be firmly attached on the outside of the journal for all to read before inserting thoughts.

In this article, the last in the two-part series, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst we look at the historical and cultural perspectives behind our country's occupancy policies.  I recently read Ms. Pader's Housing Occupancy Standards:  Inscribing Ethnicity and Family Relations on the Land, published in the Journal of Architectural and Planning Research in the winter of 2002.

As you read along with me, I ask that you do so with an open mind.  Step outside the lens of your role as a housing provider to gain greater perspective.  Warning:  Ms. Pader's vocabulary is rich but dense; I hope the excerpts I have selected here are not too arduous.

Individuals or entities that sell a manufactured home on behalf of another person have always required a license. If I am a licensed real estate agent, can I sell manufactured homes?In some cases, real estate brokers will need an MSD license. If a manufactured structure is sold separate from the sale of the land, this is considered a personal property transaction and requires an MSD license. The sale of a manufactured structure and land in a single transaction is a real estate transaction and requires a real estate license (but not an MSD license). I sell Park Model structures. Do I need a DFCS dealer's license to sell these structures?Yes. Except for person-to-person sales, any individual or entity engaged in selling manufactured homes is required to get a license. If you are a park owner and you sell less than 10 manufactured homes in a year, you may apply for a limited license. You can apply for either license online at https://licensesonline.dcbs.oregon.gov/MyLicense Enterprise/ What is the purpose of a limited dealer's license?The limited license allows a park owner to sell up to ten homes per year within the licensee's park without having to obtain a full dealer license. ORS 446.706 What are the bonding requirements for a manufactured structures dealer?A bond or letter of credit is required before a license is issued. The bond must be submitted with your application on a Division of Finance and Corporate Securities surety bond form (Form 440-2966) . How do I apply for a manufactured structures dealer license?To apply for a regular or a limited license, submit a completed application form to the Division of Finance and Corporate Securities. Alternatively, you can take advantage of the department's online licensing system - License 2000/My License. This system provides licensees a robust set of tools to apply for, renew, update, or check license status via the web. More information can be found online at https://licensesonline.dcbs.oregon.gov/MyLicense Enterprise/. How do I make changes to my manufactured structures dealer license?If dealers need to change the street address, mailing address, or the DBA or ABN on their license, a correction to the license must be submitted and a $30 fee applies. Please note, the legal name on the license cannot be changed, only the DBA or ABN. As a dealership, if I want to open another sales center, do I need another license?Dealer licenses are good for one location only. If a dealer has, or intends to open, a branch office at a different location under the same business name and license, the dealer must apply for a supplemental license. Does a dealer need a trip permit to move a new home between dealer inventory lots?No. New homes identified as dealer inventory may be moved between a dealer's inventory lots provided the dealer has obtained a supplemental dealer license for the lots in question. Please note that a trip permit is required whenever a used home is moved from one site or dealer location to another. As a dealer, am I subject to taxation on a home I have installed as a spec home?If you have a supplemental license for the home's location, the home is considered inventory.See ORS 446.576 How should a dealer handle a spec home that is placed in a manufactured home park?The statute makes provisions for a dealer to license a park as a dealer site from which the home can be sold. In essence, this means that the initial placement of a spec home on a lot in a park, before it has actually been sold, would be viewed as movement from a dealer lot to a dealer lot. Can an Escrow Agent complete the sales transaction of a manufactured structure on behalf of my dealership?Yes, provided the conditions specified in ORS 446.591 are met.

If you contacts with any of the members or staff of the Oregon Congressional delegation please let the MHCO office know.  This is a very important piece of Federal Legislation and we do not want to miss any opportunity to help pass this legislation.  Thank you.) On May 15th, the Senate Banking Committee approved legislation (currently unnumbered) on a 13-9 vote that would eliminate Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and overhaul the nation's secondary housing finance market.The bill, authored by Chairman Tim Johnson (D-SD) and ranking member Mike Crapo (R-ID), now moves to the full Senate. A floor vote this year appears unlikely after several key Democrats on the panel voted against the plan out of concern that it goes too far in eliminating the current system and does not do enough to preserve affordable housing finance options.The bill expands on legislation introduced last year by Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) and replaces Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a system where the government would explicitly guarantee big losses in the housing market but that relies on the private sector to play a larger role than it currently does in funding new mortgages.Included in the Johnson-Crapo bill are provisions explicitly requested by MHI that would allow manufactured home loans, including those secured by personal property, full access to the newly envisioned secondary market system.Included in the legislation is a provision requiring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to review the impact HOEPA High-Cost Mortgage and Loan Originator provisions are having on credit availability in the manufactured housing market. The language also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to complete a study on how these provisions impact credit available to those seeking to purchase manufactured housing. The provisions, which were requested by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), were adopted during mark up. Despite strong objections from majority members of the committee over any efforts to include Dodd-Frank-related amendments, the Manchin provisions represented a compromise approach and will serve to ensure that the CFPB remains focused on the need to provide the manufactured housing market with relief from recent rulemakings.Committee Prepares for Recorded Vote on Manufactured Housing LegislationOn May 22nd, the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to take recorded votes on a number of measures reforming portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Included in this will be the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1779). The committee marked up a number of measures on May 7th. H.R. 1779 was approved by voice vote, but a recorded vote was requested. While the measure is expected to formally be approved by the committee next week, the recorded vote is an opportunity to underscore the bipartisan support that exists for the bill. Once approved by the committee, the measure will await floor consideration.During the mark up, the measure received bipartisan support from the committee's ranking member Maxine Waters (D-CA) and bill cosponsor Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL). Others speaking in strong support of the measure included Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) and Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Steve Pearce (R-NM).The bill would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to change the criteria by which home loans are classified ""high-cost"" while keeping in place strong consumer protections. Sponsored by Representatives Stephen Fincher (R-TN), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), and Gary Miller (R-CA), the bill is cosponsored by 113 House Members on both sides of the aisle. The legislation would also clarify that manufactured home retailers and salespersons would not be considered loan originators unless they receive compensation from a lender, mortgage broker or loan originator. The CFPB ""loan originator"" definition effective since January, is based on traditional mortgage market roles that do not equate with the business model of the manufactured housing industry, including lending and retail sales practices. Without this clarification, manufactured home buyers will be unable to receive guidance on the limited manufactured home financing resources available.",839,1,1400255529,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0489,13644,community_updates,und,MEASURE TO PRESERVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MANUFACTURED HOUSING  CLEARS KEY HURDLE IN U.S. HOUSE,"<p>The House Financial Services Committee Passes Bipartisan Legislation to Protect the Availability of Financing for Manufactured Homes (Editor's Note: As mentioned in the earlier article with the passage of similar legislation pending in the US Senate, MHCO is working with the Oregon Congressional delegation to ensure passage of this critical legislation.)</p><p>Washington, DC - The U.S. House Financial Services Committee today passed the bipartisan Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1779) to protect the ability of manufactured home customers to buy, sell and refinance affordable manufactured homes, the largest form of unsubsidized affordable housing in the nation. Specifically, the bill would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to address the criteria by which home loans are classified ""high-cost"" while keeping in place strong consumer protections. Sponsored by Representatives Stephen Fincher (R-TN), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), and Gary Miller (R-CA), the bill is also supported and cosponsored by an additional 110 House Members on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>""The ability to access affordable manufactured homes is vital to millions of low- and moderate-income Americans, and our industry is also an important economic driver and job creator in many communities across the country,"" said Nathan Smith, Chairman of the Manufactured Housing Institute. ""This legislation would ensure that manufactured housing remains a viable affordable housing option, particularly in rural, distressed and underserved areas. We urge the full House of Representative to move swiftly to consider this important legislation."" The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), through a rulemaking process required under Dodd-Frank, deemed that all purchase loans-including mortgages on manufactured homes considered personal property-be covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Under these guidelines, many small-balance loans used for the purchase of affordable manufactured housing are now unfairly classified as predatory and high-cost. Unfortunately, the CFPB failed to recognize the uniqueness of manufactured home loans compared to the rest of the housing industry.</p><p>While the cost of originating and servicing a $250,000 loan and a $25,000 loan are the same in terms of real dollars, the cost as a percentage of each loan's size is significantly different. This difference causes the smaller-sized manufactured home loan to potentially exceed the new thresholds and be categorized as a HOEPA high-cost loan.</p><p>Due to the increased lender liabilities associated with making a HOEPA high-cost loan, it is unlikely that these loans will be offered to homebuyers, denying access to necessary credit for new and existing manufactured homes. In fact, industry lenders have already stopped originating loans of less than $20,000 as a result of the new rule. According to the American Housing Survey, roughly half of the nation's 8.5 million manufactured homes have a purchase price of less than $30,000.</p><p>Manufactured home loans perform just as well, if not better, than loans on site-built counterparts and are serviced in a responsible and consumer-friendly manner. This is evidenced by delinquency rates among manufactured housing lenders that are half of what is reported in the larger mortgage market.</p><p>Eliminating this important source of financing would unfairly penalize low and moderate-income homebuyers who do not qualify for traditional mortgage financing needed for single family home ownership; do not have access to limited government-insured and GSE secondary market programs; or live in rural areas where affordable rental housing is scarce or non-existent. Additionally, millions of families could see the equity they have diligently built up in their manufactured homes wiped out because lenders would be unwilling to provide the financing needed for resale.</p><p>""Homeowners who purchased safe, energy efficient homes that they can afford rather than taking out a loan they could not pay back should not be punished, and we are thankful so many lawmakers have backed this effort to protect the more than 22 million Americans living in manufactured homes,"" added Smith.</p><p>The bipartisan legislation would also clarify that manufactured home retailers and salespersons would not be considered loan originators unless they receive compensation from a lender, mortgage broker or loan originator. The new CFPB definition of a loan originator is based on traditional mortgage market roles that do not equate with the business model of the manufactured housing industry, including lending and retail sales practices.</p><p>A similar bipartisan bill has been introduced in the Senate, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2013 (S. 1828), by Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Tom Coburn (R-OK).</p>",839,1,1400788542,1511230134,1,0,0,0,0490,13645,community_updates,und,"MHCO's 2014-15 Legislative ""Wish List""","This week the Manufactured Home Community Landlord-Tenant Coalition.

Some state and local provisions cover marital status and other classifications as well.</p><p>The manual produced by the Oregon Newspapers group states, ""Charges of discrimination are more likely now, whether or not they will be proven ultimately before a judge. ...There are `fair housing councils' active in many localities that are pursuing creators and publishers of alleged illegal advertising. It is to everyone's benefit, especially to the benefit of the advertisers and readers of newspapers and the consumers of residential housing, if we are scrupulous about learning the provisions of the law.""</p><p>The Oregon newspapers group created the manual in response to a battery of fair housing violation charges levied against 13 Oregon newspapers in late 1991 by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon.</p><p>The fact that newspapers are included in the liability loop doesn't mean real estate agents and brokerages placing advertisements are excluded. Indeed, real estate agents are under even closer scrutiny. Additionally, as the Oregon manual notes, the discrimination doesn't have to be intentional. Ignorance of the law's particulars is no excuse.</p><p>And while fairness and common sense go far in assuring compliance with the Act, it takes closer study to truly understand the laws' scope and consequences as the example ad at the opening of this article demonstrates.</p><p>The most effective general guideline emphasized by both NAR and the Oregon Newspapers group is succinctly stated in the Oregon manual: ""The English language is rich and so are writers' imaginations. We can write enticingly and persuasively about the property. Just avoid referring to the kinds of people who might live in a particular dwelling, because that is where discrimination sneaks in.""</p><p>In other words, mention number of bedrooms not number of people; in a rental ad specify ""no drinking"" and ""no smoking,"" not non-drinkers and non-smokers. Even a phrase as seemingly innocuous as ""handyman's dream"" should raise a caution flag. In the wrong context it could be construed as indicating preference for a single male. The solution? Stick to ""fixer-upper.""</p><p>Emphasize amenities, not potential participants: tennis courts, not tennis players; paths, not bicyclists.</p><p>Emphasizing a property's proximity to certain landmarks also creates some potential problems. A home billed as near a ""church,"" or ""synagogue,"" or ""temple,"" could be interpreted as an attempt to steer a certain religious group to or away from the area. Even some neighborhood names in certain cities have taken on a type of code status that suggests poverty, affluence, ethnic background or national origin.</p><p>The Oregon manual suggests sticking with geographical-type locations such as northwest, southeast, or street names.</p><p>While the tone of this article is, perhaps, a tad bitter, I have to agree with much of what it has to say. The FHCO and other fair housing organizations across the country have, in fact, as part of our missions helped enforce fair housing laws including the Federal Fair Housing Act's (FHA) provision that it is illegal to publish, or cause to be published, any illegally discriminatory statement. It is true, as well, that intent is not the barometer used to determine if any portion of the FHA has been violated. In fact, HUD has very recently provided clarity on the matter, codifying a long-used legal precedent that FHA prohibits practices that result in illegal discrimination regardless of whether there was intent to discriminate.""""</p>""",839,0,1406916044,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012880,15980,community_updates,und,Summer 2014 Legislative Update,"<p>Last month the manufactured housing landlord-tenant coalition met to continue discussing issues in preparation for the 2015 Oregon Legislative session.

Back taxes owed on abandoned MHs (ORS 90.675 (14) 2. Who collects the $6 assessment on manufactured homes to fund the Manufactured Communities Resource Center (MCRC) 3. Revising ORS 90.630 regarding the cure period for ongoing versus discrete violations 4. Manufactured home sales conflicts with owner sales versus tenant sales</p><h3>1. Back taxes owed on abandoned MHs (ORS 90.675 (14)</h3><p>The negotiations on this statute focus on the situation where the current market value of the abandoned home is more than $8,000 and the proceeds of the sale don't cover the landlord costs and the past due taxes that have accumulated. In these cases, the financial incentive for the landlord when there is no purchaser at the abandonment sale is to destroy the home. Most community owners are not willing to pay $12,000 in taxes for a $9,000 home.</p><p>MHCO's position is to reduce this tax burden on the community owner as much as possible either by completely eliminating the tax obligation or reducing it as far as possible. The county tax assessors proposed eliminating up to $8,000 of the tax liability. MHCO's position is that the amount waived needs to be higher so that the economics of keeping abandoned homes in the community pencils out. We will be back in August negotiating this issue further, but it remains MHCO's top legislative issue.</p><h3>2. Who collects the $6 assessment on manufactured homes to fund the Manufactured Communities Resource Center (MCRC)</h3><p>Currently, ORS 446.525 imposes an annual $6 assessment on all manufactured homes which are taxed as personal property, meaning that they are not real estate (on land with joint ownership of the MH and the land or in a co-op or with a 20 year lease). The county assessor is responsible for collecting the assessment and forwarding the revenue to OHCS for MCRC. The concept is to collect this special assessment with the annual property taxes owed. This applies regardless of whether the MH is in a park.</p><p>MCRC estimates that the special assessment plus the $25 registration fee for all parks generated $443,051 in FY 2013 and $422,627 in FY 2014.</p><p>There are an estimated 63,000 MHs in parks; at $6 apiece, that would be $378,000/year. But the assessment is paid by non-park MHs, too.</p><p>In the past couple of years Multnomah County and some other counties have expressed a desire to get out of the business of collecting the $6 assessment. Multnomah County is drafting a bill for the 2015 Legislative Session exempting it from having to collect the $6 assessment</p><p>County tax collectors feel that, as a matter of principle, they should only collect taxes for their costs and for other local governments. This is not a tax.</p><p>Some manufactured home residents don't pay property taxes, either because of the senior tax deferral program or because of the ORS 308.250 cancellation of taxes on low-value (currently $15,500) MHs. That means the county bills those residents only for the $6. And, with the early payment 3 percent discount, the actual amount owed is only $5.82. The counties' cost to collect this amount exceeds the amount collected.</p><p>The coalition discussed increasing the assessment to $10 per manufactured home and possibly use some of the extra money to compensate the counties or MCRC to cover the cost to collect. Another proposal would expand this fee to floating homes. MHCO's position is to avoid having the community owner collecting the assessed fee from the residents and then passing the accumulated fees on to the Oregon Department of Revenue. The issue remains open to further negotiation.</p><h3>3. Revising ORS 90.630 regarding the cure period for ongoing versus discrete violations</h3><p>Manufactured home community residents who own and occupy their MHs and rent the space under the home in a community can only have their tenancies terminated for cause. Those causes are defined, to some degree, in ORS 90.630. The statute allows the tenant to cure the cause, within the 30 day notice period, and thereby avoid the termination. In some cases, the result of this cure right means that a tenant may continue the conduct which is the cause up until the 30th day.</p><p>Over the years, many of you have contacted the MHCO office to discuss 30 day notices of eviction and in the process expressed frustration that residents who where disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of other residents or where violating the rules and regulations in the community could continue living in the community till the end of the 30 day period after the notice had been served. As many of you have said to me on the phone, So basically they can misbehave for 30 days and we can't do a thing....""</p><p>We continue to discuss what conduct should be stopped immediately and what conduct should be allowed the full 30 days to cure. Phil Querin has suggested using the distinction that anything that materially impacts other residents should require a shorter period to cure. Some feel this is too subjective - where do you draw the line: failure to mow grass; large campaign sign for Kitzhaber; loud music; foul odors coming out of a home etc.</p><p>We will continue to discuss this issue in the months ahead. MHCO recognizes this is an important issue to both community owners/managers and residents. It remains one of our top legislative priorities.</p><h3>4. Manufactured home sales conflicts with owner sales versus tenant sales</h3><p>There have been some alleged abuses in situations where residents are trying to sell their homes and the community owner has other homes in the community that he/she are selling. Some residents claim that this inherent conflict results in their homes either not selling or selling at a substantially reduced price.</p><p>The State of Oregon has been investigating this through the Department of Consumer and Business Services. It is not clear what action the State wants to take - or other legislators for that matter. One of the proposals considered by the state is to prohibit issuance of any type of Manufactured Structure Dealer license to any mobile home or manufactured dwelling park owner or onsite park management representative. Other less draconian measures would be to adopt a ""best practices"".</p><p>Needless to say this is an issue that MHCO that will be watched closely. MHCO opposes eliminating your ability sell homes in your community. This may be an issue we will have to fight in the 2015 Oregon Legislative Session.</p>""",839,1,1407716194,1511230134,1,0,0,0,012888,15988,community_updates,und,Sensible Innovation for Financing Homes in the Dodd-Frank Era,"<p align=""center""><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">By &nbsp;Anthony Ducharme,&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Direct Channel Manager, Mountainside Financial, a division of San Antonio Credit Union.&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://mountainsidefinancial.com/"" style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">mountainsidefinancial.com</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">.&nbsp;</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em><u><strong>Editor's Note:</strong></u></em> &nbsp;MHCO is excited to host Anthony Ducharme as one of many speakers at the 2014 MHCO Annual Conference. &nbsp;If you are looking for the latest on how to finance homes in your community - in addition to how to access the ""carve out"" that MHCO negotiated in the last Oregon Legislative Session will you not want to miss this seminar! &nbsp;Sign up today!</div><p align=""center"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center""><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The Direct Team has always been a consumer-focused service platform.

The back taxes owed on some abandoned MHs may be significant, even exceeding the value of the manufactured home. In these cases, the financial incentive for the landlord, assuming there is no purchaser at the required abandoned property sale, is to destroy or give away the manufactured home. This creates a vacant space in the park.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MHCO would like to see all taxes on an abandoned manufactured home waived.&nbsp; The tax assessor association proposed waiving the first $8,000 of taxes owed to be waived if the landlord buys the home.&nbsp; At this time the MHCO is considering options to raise that amount or to completely waive the taxes owed.&nbsp; Again, no final decision has been made and negotiations continue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cure Period for Discrete vs. Ongoing Violations.&nbsp; </strong>As we have mentioned in earlier legislative updates, MHCO would like to see the 30-day cure"" (ORS 90.630) period reviewed with some changes.&nbsp; Allowing a resident to continue disruptive behavior for 29 days and then correct the behavior just before the 30 day ""cure"" period ends does not seem fair to the other residents in the community and management.&nbsp; We continue to discuss options.&nbsp; MHCO has proposed &nbsp;that anything that impacts the resident's ""peaceful enjoyment"" should require a shorter ""cure"" period.&nbsp; Again - no final decision was made and we will continue to discuss this at the next coalition meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Manufactured Home Sales - Conflict Community Owner Sales vs. Resident Sales.&nbsp; </strong>The Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) has been investigating conflicts between community owner sales of homes and resident sales.&nbsp; DCBS has met with the coalition on several occasions but no specific proposal has been put on the table.&nbsp; This is the issue that MHCO is most concerned about as we head into the 2015 Legislative session.&nbsp; There will be a more in depth discussion on this issue at the next meeting.&nbsp; MHCO will keep you posted as this issue develops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fixes to Resident Purchase.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;There are several issues that have been discovered regarding the resident purchase program (HB 4038) that was passed in the 2014 February session.&nbsp; Below is a brief summary of the issue and the proposed solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A.

Rape in a marriage was legal until 1976. &nbsp;Is the older adult comfortable talking about his or her body? Another reason cases go unreported is because no one inquires how an older person is doing with changes in their lives.&nbsp; For example, when an adult child moves back in with the older person the assumption is it's a positive change.&nbsp; Does the older person get asked about the change in his or her living situation? Elder abuse can also be physically hidden. &nbsp;When an older adult is hurt it can go unnoticed because of the belief that bruises and falls are part of the aging process.</span></p><p>While we know that anyone in a trusting relationship with the older person has the potential to be abusive, the dynamic is still predominantly intimate partner violence.&nbsp; This can be a long term relationship that has had abuse occurring all throughout the history of the relationship.&nbsp; Another form is a new relationship, possible post-divorce or widowed.&nbsp; In this relationship an older person may have experienced abuse in the past or this may be his or her first experience with abuse.&nbsp; Late Onset is a description of a relationship that has changed with an organic condition.&nbsp; The abusive person could have been controlling and verbally abusive and now is physically abusive.&nbsp; Or abuse may have not been present in the history of the relationship and now is, due to an organic condition such as dementia or capacity changes.&nbsp; Another dynamic is a person who was abused in the past and is now abusing the abuser.&nbsp; Believing, safety planning and collaboration are key in supporting the older survivor.</p><p>Take action by not letting the older folks in your lives be invisible.&nbsp; Try to notice when your older neighbor isn't around or big changes occur in his or her lives.&nbsp; An adult child moving in, mobility changing, caregivers that aren't consistent or anyone that appears to be controlling the older person's life.&nbsp; Are the same support folks coming around or has something changed? Try to give that older adult some private space to have a safe conversation.&nbsp; Often, if the abuser thinks the older adult might be asking for help or telling others about the controlling behaviors, the abuser will retaliate.&nbsp; This could be punishing, physically and emotionally abusing or further isolation. Connecting with your local Adult Protective Services agency, Domestic Violence Agency and Social Service Senior agencies are a key way to help the older adult.&nbsp; The collaboration of these agencies can provide protection and support by the way of Elderly/Disabled Persons Abuse Prevention Act, criminal charges, emotional and resource support.</p>",23,0,1412959699,1414434653,1,0,0,0,012926,16026,community_updates,und,Legislative Update:  MHCO Wins Major Concession on Abandoned Home Back Taxes,"<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Last week MHCO met with representatives of the Oregon county tax assessors and successfully negotiated the elimination of abandoned home back taxes.</span></p><p>For those you who have been following this issue - earlier this year MHCO set out to make significant changes to ORS 90.675 that requires community owners to pay the back taxes owed on an abandoned home if they want to purchase the home and keep it in their community.&nbsp;

The group has been meeting since June 2014 - at least once a month to address a variety of issues.&nbsp; The issues have been significantly narrowed down as we rapidly approach the end of these negotiations.&nbsp; The odds are that there will either be a compromise bill (typically know as the coalition bill) or we could face some nasty political battles on some onerous legislation.&nbsp; The coalition provides a venue for both landlords and tenants to work through selected issues.&nbsp;

We are starting to get a much better sense of what legislative proposals are moving forward and which ones will likely remain in committees and not see the light of day until perhaps the next legislative session in 2017.<br /><br />The ""tenant rights"" bill HB 4143A passed out of the Oregon House Rules Committee late yesterday afternoon with the ""dash 14A"" amendment which addressed MHCO's last issue - the extension to 90 days for ""no cause"" evictions. This amendment returns ""no cause"" evictions to 60 days for tenancies over 1 year. With the adoption of this amendment manufactured home communities in Oregon will face NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES from this legislative session. There will be no rent control or rent justificiation. The one year limit on rent increases will impact only apartments - NOT manufactured home communities. HB 4143A heads to the House floor for a vote then on to the Senate. MHCO does not expect any ""anti-landlord"" language to be added as we head over to the Senate chamber.<br /><br />The other legislation MHCO is watching is SB 1533 the ""inclusionary zoning"" bill. This bill is up for a public hearing tomorrow in the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue. Since it is only scheduled for a public hearing the bill will not move out of committee until possibly later this week. Time is starting to run out on this legislative session and there is little room for bills to stall.<br /><br />This has turned out to be a very successful legislative session for community owners in Oregon.

Querin, MHCO Legal Counsel</strong></p><p>The difference between a well-run manufactured housing community and one with problems frequently lies with the rules and regulations each facility has adopted.&nbsp; Here are some tips for developing a set of rules and regulations that may be helpful in the successful operation of your community:</p><ol>	<li><strong><u>Avoid Ambiguity.</u></strong>&nbsp; When writing a rule, make sure that it is understandable.&nbsp; If a court or jury were called upon to enforce it, would they be able to understand it?&nbsp; Is it fair?&nbsp; Is the rule capable of different interpretations?&nbsp; Is it too vague so as to give little or no guidance to the tenant?&nbsp; Avoid using general terms which are so subjective that reasonable people could differ about what constitutes a violation.&nbsp; If necessary, use an example.&nbsp; If the rule must necessarily be open-ended (e.g. prohibiting loud and disturbing noise or offensive behavior), tie the violation to whether the conduct results in complaints from other tenants.&nbsp; That way the issue does not become whether the manager is arbitrarily exercising his or her own discretion.</li>	<li><strong><u>Updating the Rules.</u></strong>&nbsp; Oregon landlord-tenant statutes can change every yerar when the Legislature meets.&nbsp; Circumstances and needs can change more frequently than that.&nbsp; At least once a year, take a look at your rules to see if they are legally sufficient and whether they meet the community's present needs.&nbsp; It is much easier to make smaller changes to the rules one or two at a time rather than trying to get the tenants to agree to a wholesale change of all the rules at once.&nbsp; If your tenants are on leases, you have the right to submit new park documents (i.e. rules and rental agreement) not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the lease term.&nbsp; A tenant shall accept or reject the landlord's proposed new rental agreement at least 30 days prior to the ending of the term by giving written notice to the landlord.&nbsp; If accepted, the rules and rental agreement will define your new rental relationship with the tenants.&nbsp; It is one good way to update your rules, without having to go through a formal rules change.</li>	<li><strong><u>Legally Adopting Your Rules.</u></strong>&nbsp; If the tenants are on month-to-month tenancies, Oregon law requires that the landlord must give at least 30 days' advance written notice to make a change in the rules.&nbsp; If 51% or more of the tenants affected by the rule change object within the 30 days of service of the notice, the change(s) will not go into effect.&nbsp; However, if less than 51% object, the new rule(s) will become effective in 60 days from the date the notice was served on the tenants.&nbsp; The law regarding the contents and timing of the notice of rule change must be strictly followed.&nbsp; ORS 90.610 describes the process.&nbsp; Read it carefully!&nbsp; And use <em><u><strong>MHCO Form 60: ""Sixty Day Notice of Rule Change""</strong></u></em>.&nbsp; Simply sending a letter to the tenants informing them of a change in the rules is insufficient.&nbsp; If the rules are not properly adopted they will not be enforceable.&nbsp; Frequently, the landlord or manager will first learn that their rules were improperly adopted when they try to enforce them.&nbsp; If one or more of the rules you seek to adopt are opposed by a small but vocal minority who lobby the rest of the tenants against your change, consider meeting with them prior to giving notice of the proposed change, in an effort to mutually draft language that everyone would find acceptable.&nbsp; If over 51% of the effected space still object, consider implementing the new rules for all <em>new</em> incoming tenants only.&nbsp; That way, over time, the new rules will have wider and wider application as the older tenants</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol>	<li value=""4""><strong><u>Keeping Track of Your Rules.</u></strong>&nbsp; If there are more than one set of rules (i.e. old rules for existing tenants and new rules that are given to new tenants) make sure you keep track of which rules apply to which tenant.&nbsp; Put copies of the applicable rules, together with the rental agreement and statement of policy, in each tenant's file.&nbsp; Attempting to enforce the wrong rules against a tenant can result in disaster.&nbsp; Show the date of the latest revision on the first page or, better yet, on the footer of each page.</li>	<li value=""5""><strong><u>Troublesome Issues.</u></strong>&nbsp; There are some issues that seem to never go away.&nbsp; Occupancy issues are one of those troublesome areas that frequently result in litigation.&nbsp; If your community has rules limiting the time a visitor can stay, make sure it is clear and unambiguous.&nbsp; Frequently tenants try to avoid these limits by calling their visitor a ""house-sitter.""&nbsp; The best approach is to set a definite date, e.g. two weeks, and require that all persons who remain over that period of time must satisfy the same requirements as imposed on incoming tenants - e.g. background check, criminal check, references, etc.&nbsp; Require that they sign the rental agreement.&nbsp; If the existing tenant attempts to get around these occupancy rules by arguing that the person is there to provide necessary assistance because of certain physical or emotional disabilities, legal counsel should be immediately consulted due to Fair Housing implications.</li>	<li value=""6""><strong><u>Consistent Enforcement.</u></strong>&nbsp; It is not uncommon for landlords and managers to grant exceptions and extensions of time for tenants to come into compliance with a particular violation.&nbsp; However, landlords can get into trouble when they ignore some violators and enforce the rules against others.&nbsp; Maintenance violations are a good example.&nbsp; In order to enforce these rules you must be consistent.&nbsp; Regular community inspections should be made.&nbsp; Warnings should be given uniformly to all violators.&nbsp; Thirty day notices should be given only as a last resort.&nbsp; If the tenant requests an extension of time to comply, put the agreement in writing.&nbsp; In those cases where legal action may need to be taken, make sure legal counsel reviews the case <em>before</em> filing the eviction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure your attorney is aware of your prior efforts to secure the tenant's compliance.&nbsp; It is always best if the tenant's file shows a clear paper-trail of your efforts to secure voluntary compliance.</li></ol><p>Rules and regulations are not foolproof.&nbsp; Some tenants will always try to find reasons why they do not apply to them.&nbsp; But clarity, consistency, and fair enforcement will go a long way in keeping peace and harmony in your manufactured housing community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",23,1,1461596411,1511230134,1,0,0,0,013162,16262,community_updates,und,Revised Form 1 and New Form 1A - Compliant With New HUD Ruling on Criminal Background Checks,"<p>MHCO has uploaded a revised Form 1 (Resident Application) and a completely new Form 1A.

and (2) the commercial functions involved in transferring goods from producer to consumer.&nbsp; A more commercial definition of marketing that might be found in a high school or college text could read something like this: ""creating a sale with the consumer for your product and/or service.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, let's look at Webster's definition of ""promoting""  -  (1) to forward or further, to encourage, to advance; (2) to raise to a more important rank, to contribute to the progress or growth of, to urge adoption of or advocate; and (3) to attempt to sell or popularize by advertising or by securing financial support.&nbsp; Again, a more commercial definition of promoting might be something like: ""bringing the consumer to your product and/or service.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These definitions tell us that we need to be involved in both promoting and marketing!&nbsp; It is the act of promoting that creates enthusiasm and brings us the traffic.&nbsp; It is the act of marketing that defines the sale of a home or signing of a lease.&nbsp; Without both of these tools in your toolkit, you would have a really hard time filling, re-filling, or upgrading your community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Deciding Why you Want to Market</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to promote because you have a new development?&nbsp; Or will it be to fill vacancies within an existing community, or to upgrade (and turn around) an older community?&nbsp; Each of these three stages of a community requires a different marketing plan, a different focus, different promotional strategies, and differing amounts of involvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing has been the subject of many volumes of material, college courses, high school courses, and numerous articles in literally thousands of magazines. There are many facets of marketing for whatever business you try to promote.&nbsp; It depends on the type of market you are in, the general state of the economy at the time you decide to start a promotion and marketing program, whether you are creating a demand or meeting a need, and several other variables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who are your Partners in Marketing?</strong></p><p>Media Sources</p><div><ul>	<li value=""8"">Motif</li>	<li value=""8"">Residents</li>	<li value=""8"">Employees</li>	<li value=""8"">Retailers</li>	<li value=""8"">Curb Appeal</li>	<li value=""8"">Vendors</li>	<li>Personal Development</li>	<li value=""8"">Professionalism</li>	<li value=""8"">Industry Knowledge</li>	<li value=""8"">Civic Involvement</li></ul></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><span style=""font-size:12px;"">The Mental Picture of Marketing</span></strong></h3><p>Every minute of every day in every dealing you have with each person, you are promoting yourself, the company you represent, your community, and the industry as a whole.&nbsp; Picture a diagram that consists of a huge wheel.&nbsp; There is a hub in the very center. It is a small circle.&nbsp; You are this hub.&nbsp; Radiating outward from this hub are eleven spokes that then connect with a huge wheel on the outside.&nbsp; Each of the eleven spokes is one of the areas of promotion we are going to discuss in this handbook.&nbsp; The huge wheel on the outside is your market: the general public, the planning and zoning officials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, this huge wheel is a never-ending stream of potential customers.&nbsp; This huge wheel also makes up the members of the general public at large.&nbsp; Everyone has an opinion.&nbsp; On this huge wheel, everyone has an opinion about manufactured housing and manufactured home communities.&nbsp; Part of a successful promotion and marketing program is to create more and more favorable opinions of the general public that is part of that huge wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the one of the eleven spokes joins the wheel, a direct line of vision, understanding and agreement is created between the hub (you) and the wheel (your market).&nbsp; Both ends of the spoke (you in the hub and the general public on the wheel) then see things the same way.&nbsp; The conduit that enables this ""coming together"" of opinion is the spoke that links you in your hub with your potential customer on the huge wheel.&nbsp; When this happens, you have successfully created a promotion (being noticed) that may result in effective marketing (a sale or lease).&nbsp;&nbsp; The other positive side effect is usually the creation of a more favorable image of the manufactured housing industry as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the public that is represented by the wheel is comprised of elected officials, your promotional efforts may result in positive zoning decisions or approval of expansion plans for a new community.&nbsp; When that public represents your customer, you will have created a sale of a home or a lease of a homesite.&nbsp; We need all kinds of people from this public arena on our side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This illustration gives you a visual image of the way a successful promotion can take you where you have never been before  -  or leave you spinning around in circles.&nbsp; You are in the center ring.&nbsp; Take charge of your promotional efforts.&nbsp; Create new markets.&nbsp; Realize new growth opportunities.&nbsp; Change the image of manufactured housing.&nbsp; It all starts with you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A successful promotion and marketing program will affect your staff, your community, your residents, their friends, their co-workers and families, the surrounding business community, and the industry as a whole in a positive way.&nbsp;

Though it's an exciting new chapter in your life, you have to consider a lot of things first, from career plans to personal goals. You also have to take into account adjusting to the married life and eventually becoming a parent.</p><p>One of the most important preparations you have to think about is where to live. You want a decent place to raise your family  -  somewhere that you can truly call your home. Many young households today don't have a clear idea of where to settle down. Usually, they'd go for anything that's not pricey or isolated.</p><p>Manufactured houses are great options for young families. For the past few years, mobile homes have gained widespread popularity. From one end of the country to the other, you can find communities of pre-fabricated homes, particularly in places like Oregon.</p><p>If you are thinking about settling down or looking for a quality property to move into, take a look at the following to know why <em>manufactured homes in Oregon</em> are a great choice:</p><p><em>Pre-fabricated homes are affordable</em></p><p>Compared to brand new modern homes, <em>manufactured housing is an affordable alternative</em> for young families. You get more value for your investment. From the actual construction of the structure to maintenance and upgrades, the cost is significantly less than what you'd spend on a stick-built house. For a starting household, this is a great selling point.</p><p><em>Mobile homes are all about quality living</em></p><p>Affordability doesn't equate to inferior living standards. In fact, families are better off with mobile homes because they offer just the solutions they need. With the number of options available, they can choose the house that suits their situation. <em>Mobiles homes in Oregon</em>, for instance, vary in design and function. From elaborate floor plans to simple yet elegant house design, you can certainly find one that matches your preferences.</p><p><em>Green Living</em></p><p>Another less obvious yet equally striking benefit of mobile homes is green living. Builders don't waste a lot of materials during construction because they have complete control over the quality. The materials themselves are made of sustainable, eco-friendly components. As they are built with having a minimal impact to the environment in mind, in a way, you are giving back to nature. Residing in a mobile home can kick start your family's green living.</p><p><em>You belong to a community</em></p><p>No place is better for raising a family than in the safety of a community. Many mobile homes are located in communities and RV parks. Our listed <em>manufactured homes in Oregon</em>, for instance, are located in some of the prime spots in the country.</p><p><em>More financing options</em></p><p>There are also more financing options available for mobile homes. Here at Complete Mobile Homes, we work closely with local and national lending institutions. You can easily get the financing resource you need, so you can finally move into your manufactured house. You may consult with our team of manufactured home professionals to know more about your financing options.</p><p>Starting a family is a major decision, so is choosing a place to live. With all the benefits of living in a manufactured home in Oregon, deciding is now much easier to do. If you want the best for your family, a mobile home is for you.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.100000381469727px; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif !important;"">Vicki A.

While everyone is trying to figure out what the impacts of policy changes by the Trump administration will be on the economy, the stock market has surged and interest rates have climbed. Both of these occurrences reflect a positive reaction to the election in the financial marketplace, however the effect on real estate and income property values remains a concern for owners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Higher interest rates certainly impact the feasibility of borrowing money, which in turn affects the purchasing power for real estate acquisitions as well as property values. Most fixed rate lenders price their loans based on US Treasury yields. Many borrowers have been focusing on rising benchmark interest rates, however the good news is that US Treasury yields today are still far lower than their long term averages. As of March 7, 2017, the 10 year US Treasury yield stood at 2.51%, compared to 1.83% on November 7, 2016, the day before the election. The 10 year US Treasury yield began 2016 at 2.24%, and 2015 at 2.12%. To provide some perspective, below is the average yield on the 10 Year US Treasury during the last 5 decades, and so far in the 2010's:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1961 - 1969:&nbsp; 4.73%</p><p>1970 - 1979:&nbsp; 7.50%</p><p>1980 - 1989: 10.59%</p><p>1990 - 1999:&nbsp; 6.67%</p><p>2000 - 2009:&nbsp; 4.46%</p><p>2010 - 2016:&nbsp; 2.38%</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have definitely enjoyed some very low interest rates over the last few years, which has benefitted borrowers and helped to support increasing property values. Most economists are predicting that ultimately Treasury yields have to return closer to these long term averages shown above, citing the Trump administration's mix of reflationary policy initiatives. Rates can always go down in the short term, however if the United States is successful at growing nominal gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years, Treasury yields could likely follow. Given this outlook, today's still historically-low interest rate environment offers an extraordinary opportunity to evaluate your near and long term financing objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding recent volatility due to the political climate and rising interest rates, the marketplace for income property financing remains very healthy, with no shortage of capital. Lenders remain optimistic for 2017, and most are planning to equal or exceed their loan origination volume from 2016. This includes lending for manufactured home communities (MHC's), an asset class of ever-increasing interest to capital providers. Volatility forces commercial lenders to gravitate towards lower risk, stable, income-producing real estate. Manufactured home communities are increasingly high on their lists, since the cash flow is consistent and demand for affordable housing is strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous institutional and private owners of manufactured home communities and other commercial real estate have taken advantage by locking in historically low fixed rate loans. In several cases, refinancing existing loans with prepayment penalties still made economic sense given the savings realized with today's low interest rate financing. If you've been considering a refinance to lower expenses, access additional capital to fund overdue projects, or facilitate additional acquisitions, it's still a great time to take a look at the programs available in today's market. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pool of varying capital sources deepened even further in 2016. Lender demand for existing, stabilized real estate transactions remains strong, despite escalated regulatory practices imposed on the industry. Over $1 Billion in commercial real estate loans will be maturing daily through the end of 2018, and the necessary lender appetite is present to service this need. Owners of manufactured home communities will benefit from this activity, as the capital marketplace for MHC's continues to expand and lenders are seeking to deploy capital on lower risk housing assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>An overview of community financing options for 2017:</u></p><p>As a result of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform policies and Basel III regulations imposed on banks, construction and high risk"" lending is tightening.

The exceptions to this rule are bills in Revenue Committees, Rules Committees and Ways and Means Committees which stay open the duration of the legislative session. The remaining bills will need to move out of committees by April 18th.<br /><br />A number of bad legislative bills that MHCO has been fighting were stopped by last week's legislative deadline. However there are three bills that remain 'alive' that are of great concern:<br /><br />HB 2004A: Prohibits landlord from terminating month-to-month tenancy without cause after first six months of occupancy except under certain circumstances with 90 days' written notice and payment of [relocation expenses] amount equal to one month's periodic rent. Provides exception for cer- tain tenancies for occupancy of dwelling unit in building or on property occupied by landlord as primary residence. Makes violation defense against action for possession by landlord. Requires fixed term tenancy to become month-to-month tenancy upon reaching specific ending date, unless tenant elects to renew or terminate tenancy. Requires landlord to make tenant offer to renew fixed term tenancy. [Repeals statewide prohibition on city and county ordinances controlling rents.] Permits city or county to implement rent stabilization program for rental of dwelling units. This bill passed the Oregon House and is now being considered in the Senate.<br /><br />HB 2008: Requires landlord of manufactured dwelling park to pay tenant necessary relocation costs or applicable manufactured dwelling park closure penalty, as determined by Office of Manufactured Dwelling Park Community Relations, upon closure of park to convert to other use. Requires owner of manufactured dwelling park to give notice of final sale to office upon sale of park. Prohibits landlord from terminating without cause, unless under certain circumstances with 90 days' written notice, month-to-month tenancy consisting of rental of manufactured dwelling of float- ing home owned by landlord on space in facility. Requires fixed term tenancy consisting of rental of manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by landlord on space in facility to become month-to-month tenancy upon reaching specific end date, unless tenant elects to renew or terminate tenancy. Requires landlord to make tenant offer to renew fixed term tenancy. Requires office to produce materials to inform tenants of rights and adopt rules to require landlords to post materials in manufactured dwelling park public spaces. Directs office to establish and administer landlord-tenant dispute resolution program. Requires office to submit annual report on progress of program to interim committees of Legislative Assembly related to housing and human services for five years. Authorizes office to impose penalties for violations of landlord-tenant law against landlords of manufactured dwelling parks. Scheduled for a legislative work session on Thrusday.<br /><br />HB 3331: Directs Office of Manufactured Dwelling Park Community Relations to establish and administer landlord-tenant dispute resolution program for disputes arising from notices of certain rent in- creases. Scheduled for legislative work session on Thursday.<br /><br />We will be sending updates on the status of these three bills as they move through the legislative process. We are expecting significant amendments to HB 2008 but not enough to change MHCO's opposition. We are also expecting significant amendments in the Senate on HB 2004A. Again, the amendments will likely not change MHCO's opposition.<br /><br />MHCO was successful in negotiating a landlord-tenant coalition bill (SB 277). This bill will be significantly amended on Wednesday in the Senate. We were also successful in exempting manufactured home communities from HB 2511. Obviously, all the bad bills left behind so far this session are a success - but we still have a lot work ahead.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have reached the halfway point of the 2017 Legislative Session.

It is undeniable that material shifts in policy are in the works, social and economic alike. Some of these will likely have an effect on the commercial real estate lending environment, including financing for manufactured home communities (MHCs). The Trump administration is already taking a new approach to banking regulations, which may at some point include working with Congress on the future of the government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, both of which are active lenders to the MHC sector. More immediately, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank) is under review by the new administration in an effort to scale back regulations enacted during Obama's presidency. And, as if we didn't have enough change going on, many economists are predicting higher interest rates this year.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In 2016, FNMA and Freddie Mac continued to be reliable lending sources for multifamily and MHC properties while having remained in conservatorship since 2008. MHCs in 2016 were again excluded from the annual lending cap placed on the GSEs by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and consequently MHC loans were generally priced with interest rate spreads well inside of those for conventional apartment properties. In December 2016, the FHFA announced that MHCs would continue to be excluded from the lending caps in 2017, which came as welcomed news to MHC property owners and lenders alike. Since Freddie Mac and FNMA will not have a limit on the volume of MHC loans they can originate this year, we anticipate they will continue to price MHC loans aggressively.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While we appear to be in a state of business as usual"" with the GSEs in the near term",23,1,1492639088,1499640917,1,0,0,0,013321,16421,community_updates,und,Oregon Legislative Update - The Home Stretch - SB 277A and HB 2008A Head to Governor - Latest on Rent Control!,"<p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">&nbsp;We are in the home stretch of the 2017 Oregon Legislative Session.

Significant budget, tax, transportation issues still need to be haggled over as the legislative session draws to a close.<br /><br />Nearly all legislative proposals MHCO has been tracking (mostly opposed) have died in committee.<br /><br /><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/emma-assets/ahwab/a3305b6fbb83db8bf1326ccb04000c9b/MHCO_Legislative_Report_5-24-17.pdf"">Click Here or at the top of this article&nbsp;&nbsp;""MHCO&nbsp;Legislative Update"" &nbsp;for&nbsp;links to bill drafts and the status of all bills actively tracked by MHCO. </a><br /><br />Two significant legislative proposals addressing manufactured home communities are on their way to the Governor's desk for signature. Here is a summary of these two bills:<br /><br />SB 277A - This is the landlord tenant coalition bill that was negotiated over several months and addresses changes to disrepair and deterioration. The bill provides clear definitions of disrepair and deterioration as well as making it clear that cosmetic or aesthetic concerns are not disrepair or deterioration. The 30 day cure period is extended to 60 days. The bill also clarifies the responsibility of new residents who purchase an existing manufactured home in the community for repairs including cosmetic or aesthetic concerns as long as those concerns are included in the community rules and the community owner gives written notice to a prospective purchaser before he or she becomes a new resident.<br /><br />HB 2008A - this bill caused a great deal of anxiety for community owners when it was introduced in January. The original bill contained nearly every legislative concept that MHCO has been fighting against for the past 20 years. MHCO negotiated with John VanLandingham (Lane County Law Center) and Representatives Marsh, Fahey and the House Speaker to reach a compromise that removed nearly all of HB 2008 and replaced it with three issues.<br /><br />The first issue increases the amount homeowners are compensated when a community CLOSES from $5,000 (single wide), $7,000 (double wide), $9,000 (triple wide) to $6,000 (single wide), $8,000 (double wide), $10,000 (triple wide) and tied future increases in compensation to CPI.<br /><br />The second issue in the compromise addressed resident-owned communities. USDA Rural Development would like to pilot their 502 1% loan program in resident-owned cooperatives, however, they won't if there are restrictions requiring a lien holder to remove an abandoned or foreclosed MH after 12 months. The compromise will give resident-owned cooperatives the flexibility to negotiate storage terms with lien holders that are beneficial to the cooperative. This, in turn, will allow the cooperative to attract lenders who offer extremely affordable loan products to manufactured homeowners in cooperatives who wish to replace older or unsafe homes with new, energy-efficient ones.<br /><br />The third issue, when a community sells the new community owner will need to report to the state - the number of vacant spaces and homes in the manufactured dwelling park; the final sale price of the community; the date the conveyance became final; and the name, address and telephone number of the new owner.<br /><br />Finally, the other issue of great concern to all landlords is RENT CONTROL. HB 2004A (the rent control bill) is in the Senate. In March the HB 2004A passed out of the Oregon House and has had a public hearing in the Senate. Final action on the bill (work session) is scheduled for the end of May. There is no indication what the Senate will do, but a number of Democratic Senators have expressed opposition. At this time all eyes are on the Senate - we should have a good idea later next week on what direction the Senate will take on rent control and the elimination of 'no cause' eviction. We will keep you posted on any developments - all should be revealed within the next two weeks.<br /><br />MHCO Legal Counsel Phil Querin will do a complete analysis and provide practical advice for all MHCO members (managers and community owners) on these new laws later this summer. In addition all necessary changes to MHCO Forms will be made as well.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 12px"">If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact the MHCO office at 503-391-4496. &nbsp;</p>",23,1,1495659994,1512941616,1,0,0,0,013323,16423,community_updates,und, MHCO Legislative Alert:  Oregon Senate Committee Drops Rent Control in Amendment to HB2004A ,"<p>This afternoon the Senate Committee on Human Services amended HB2004A with a dash 9 amendment that DOES NOT include rent stabilization, rent control or the elimination of the preemption of local rent control.

The DOJ became involved after the tenant filed a complaint with HUD.&nbsp;<br /><br />At trial, the resident, her treating therapist, and an independent expert testified that Riley assisted the resident in living with the symptoms of her disabilities, including providing emotional support, helping to predict migraines, and reducing suicidal thoughts. The resident also testified that she repeatedly informed the landlord that charging a deposit for a service animal was illegal, but the landlord continued to levy this charge and, at one point, threatened to evict her.&nbsp;<br /><br />The verdict includes $31,000 in compensatory damages and punitive damages for the resident, and $6,000 for a fair housing organization that assisted her with her HUD complaint.&nbsp;<br /><br />Persons with disabilities have the right to live in and enjoy their communities",23,1,1499811679,1512941802,1,0,0,0,013335,16435,community_updates,und,MHCO Legislative Update - 2017 Oregon Legislature Ends - House Speaker Vows To Continue Push for Rent Control,"<div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 12px;"">After working through much of the 4th of July weekend and holiday legislators wrapped up their legislative business today.

So - no rent control and no changes to 'no cause' eviction.&nbsp;<br /><br />These issues (rent control and 'cause eviction') will not be going away and will return in the 2018 'short' legislative session. House Speaker Kotek issued a press release earlier today stating - ""We made good progress, but we need to do more to protect renters from staggering rent spikes and no- cause evictions. In 2018, we will push to finish this session's unfinished business on housing ..."".

Our success this session would not have been possible without the active engagement of MHCO members.

Without YOUR INVOLVEMENT we would have faced a very different outcome. The quality and quantity of YOUR INVOLVEMENT made the difference.

Nonetheless, 2018 is positioned to be another very strong year from a real estate capital markets perspective. Providers of capital across the industry are planning to match or exceed their lending and investment volume from last year. 2017 saw the manufactured home community (MHC) industry continue to benefit from a growing shortage of affordable housing in markets across the United States. Furthermore, demand increases have outpaced supply for MHC assets, a trend that should continue throughout 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most investors and capital providers believe that 2018 will be an excellent time to consume and deploy capital, either by selling assets, acquiring value-add acquisitions, or taking advantage of attractive fixed and floating rate financing. Capitalization rates (the rate of return) for well-located, quality manufactured home communities remain aggressively low, as relatively slow deal flow cannot keep pace with the amount of desired equity deployment from institutional and private investors. Thus, we continue to see more flexible investment strategies across the board, as groups struggle to deploy a plentiful amount of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an example, we have seen institutional and private investors with a traditional focus on Class A (top quality) MHC's in major U.S. metro areas expand their focus to include Class B and C properties in these same markets, or in secondary or smaller U.S. markets. The continuing disappearance of distressed acquisition opportunities, and the unwillingness of owners of Class A MHC's to sell, has forced certain investors to look at value-add deals that require more complex business plans to achieve acceptable investment returns. Buyers acquiring MHC's are still benefitting from very attractive fixed and floating interest rate financing, and interest-only payments, which help support higher transaction price points. Furthermore, investors understand that most assets will continue to benefit from additional revenue growth over the course of the coming years, and are often willing to factor this growth into present day valuations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From an MHC financing perspective, liquidity continues to increase and various capital sources are showing more flexibility and aggressiveness as they try to keep pace with their dollar volume allocations. This translates to a very favorable financing environment for owners and buyers of MHC's.&nbsp;Life insurance companies are generally increasing real estate allocations, and can offer extremely attractive non-recourse long term financing solutions (up to 40 years) for owners looking to lock in today's still low interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen life company lenders reduce credit spreads (the method by which loan interest rates are priced), lengthen amortization schedules, and provide interest-only payment options before amortization kicks in.

Kayse Jama, a 43-year-old Somali immigrant and community organizer collected 13 percent of the vote.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Monroe, 75, a five-term senator, was vulnerable because the race centered on housing. The owner of a 51-unit apartment complex in East Portland, Monroe alienated tenant advocates and fellow Democrats last year when he opposed a bill that would have restricted evictions and allowed some rent controls.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Monroe spent heavily to defend his seat, raising nearly $385,000 -- much of it from the real estate industry -- and spent most of it.

In other words, the so-called ""stability'' mentioned by the city, is achieved by preventing MHC owners from closing their parks and converting them to other uses. While it is true that park owners may apply for a zone change and comprehensive plan amendment if they want to close their park and convert it to another use, the same is true for any other owner of property anywhere else in the city, who wishes to establish a new use that is otherwise prohibited by the city's current zoning code and comprehensive plan.

Friedman - The Oregonian/OregonLive</p><p>Published 8-20-18</p><p>The Portland City Council will&nbsp;soon consider an ordinance to cap what landlords can charge for security deposits and limit how they may use renters' credit and criminal conviction history to deny them tenancy.</p><p>""Screening criteria and security deposit reform"" will be the subject of an upcoming council agenda item, Commissioner Chloe Eudaly wrote in an August 14 post to her Facebook page. The ordinance is scheduled for a hearing September 20, said Eudaly spokeswoman Margaux Weeke.</p><p>It is exactly the kind of move that Oregon landlords feared when they&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/08/landlords_prep_for_new_fights.html"">banded together</a>&nbsp;to try to raise $2 million to fight those and other restrictions they say will undermine their businesses.</p><p>Policymakers in other cities have also explored regulating security deposits, citing mounting pressures on renters who struggle to save up cash for move-in fees. New York City's comptroller in July introduced a deposit-limiting measure. The Seattle City Council adopted a similar ordinance in December 2016, and landlords filed a lawsuit to challenge it.</p><p>In Portland, landlords may currently charge what they like as a security deposit, and there are few regulations over how deposits must be returned after a tenant vacates. That would change under&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/article/695056"">Eudaly's ordinance</a>. In the Facebook post, Eudaly described one an effect of the ordinance as ""limit security deposit requirements.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ordinance would also change how landlords may use information about potential tenants. Property owners typically perform criminal records and credit history checks on rental applicants. Some renter advocates have described the background checks as offering landlords a pretense for discriminating against those with criminal pasts or poor credit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eudaly said&nbsp;in her Facebook post that changing how landlords may use information about rental applicants&nbsp;to deny them tenancy is in part intended to ""reduce barriers to housing"" and ""prevent discrimination.""</p><p>According to a draft of the ordinance provided by Eudaly's office, she has considered establishing a system that requires landlords to approve tenants on a first-come, first-served basis, though a minimum credit score would still be allowed.</p><p>To deny applicants, landlords would be required to rank applicants on their credit history, criminal convictions and housing record and give them a chance to provide favorable information. &nbsp;</p><p>The draft ordinance includes a list of crimes that are not to be judged by landlords as meaning a tenant convicted of them would likely&nbsp;harm the property or cause the premises to be unsafe, if the applicant was sentenced at least three years prior or released from prison one year prior. The list&nbsp;includes felony assault and battery, felony burglary or breaking-and-entering, stalking and misdemeanor domestic violence, dealing or manufacturing illegal drugs, and non-forcible sex offenses, among others.</p>",23,1,1534814228,1534820221,1,0,0,0,013500,16600,community_updates,und,Oregonian Editorial: Eudaly's Proposed Tenant Protections Miss The Mark,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oregonian Editorial Board</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Printed 9-16-18</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Portland's elected officials are doing their part to promote the $652.8 million regional housing bond going to voters this November.

The intent, policy director Jamey Duhamel told The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, is to ensure fair rental practices while helping needy renters, whose monthly income, criminal background, or credit history would typically turn off potential landlords.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The motivation seems understandable. The method, however, leaves much to be desired. Eudaly's&nbsp;<a href=""http://media.oregonlive.com/opinion_impact/other/2018/09/16/Screening%20Criteria%20Framework-DRAFT%2017.pdf"">eight-page proposal</a>&nbsp;as currently drafted is heavy-handed, overly complicated and forces so much financial and legal risk onto landlords that many may opt to leave the rental business altogether. And the bigger question remains: How do these policies make housing any more affordable?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2018/08/20/landlords-outraged-by-commissioner-chloe-eudalys-proposal-to-limit-screenings-of-tenant-criminal-history/"">many concerns in the latest version</a>&nbsp;released: landlords aren't allowed to require that applicants show&nbsp;a monthly income of more than twice the monthly rent, even though three times monthly rent is more typical as assurance that a tenant can afford the payments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Landlords must go through an extensive and confusing matrix of questions in evaluating whether an applicant's criminal history merits a denial. And landlords must issue a written explanation to tenants who are denied after being vetted. The ""notice of denial"" must detail the reasons for turning down the applicant and establish that they are ""highly and substantially more probably to be true than not that the applicant as a tenant will adversely affect the substantial, legitimate, non-discriminatory interest of the landlord.""</p><p>It's not just a daunting set of poorly-written requirements. It's also an invitation to rejected applicants to sue.</p><p>Duhamel said Eudaly's office is focusing on how to ""fine-tune"" the proposal, which is tentatively scheduled to go before the City Council next month, to ease the administrative burden. But&nbsp;the flaws in the policy aren't going to be fixed by fine-tuning. The problems are baked into the fundamental assumptions underlying the policy.</p><p>For example, the screening proposal seems to assert that the city - not landlords - should get to decide how much financial risk landlords should bear. Citizens have not and should not hand over that kind of authority to city commissioners who believe their policy choices trump an individual's financial autonomy.</p><p>It also fails to consider that there are many landlords and affordable-housing groups that already accept tenants with criminal histories or credit problems. They do so not by following a rigid list of criteria but after considering the mix of tenants or other location-specific issues that make a tenant more suitable in one building than another.</p><p>And it neglects to address&nbsp;<a href=""http://cityobservatory.org/portlands-brouhaha-over-housing-market-economics-101/"">the underlying reason that people are struggling</a>&nbsp;to find affordable places to live - a lack of housing on every income level caused by years of underbuilding. Instead, such onerous mandates on landlords - with limited ways to protect against the risk - could prompt some to drastically raise rent when units become vacant or take the property out of the rental market entirely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Duhamel said that, in her opinion, only a handful of landlords would likely get out of the business altogether, dismissing ""what if"" concerns as ""fearmongering."" But she acknowledges the city has no data on how a previous policy - mandatory relocation assistance to tenants whose leases are not renewed - may have affected the rental market.</p><p>Others,&nbsp;who&nbsp;admittedly represent&nbsp;the landlord viewpoint, say it has definitely led to the loss of many rentals. Since the beginning of the year, 30 landlords who used the Garcia Group property management firm decided to sell their properties, owner Ron Garcia told The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board. That's a tenth of the ownership portfolio, he said, and many of the properties were condos or single-family homes that likely went to buyers seeking to occupy, rather than rent, the property.</p><p>The region's housing crisis is real with thousands of homeless people living on the street and many more on the brink as wages don't keep pace with rent. But landlords' screening policies aren't the reason Portland is in a housing crisis. Leaders should focus on the true culprit - the need for more housing at all income levels - and make sure they don't unwittingly become an accomplice.</p><p><em>-Helen Jung for The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",23,1,1537376979,1537376979,1,0,0,0,013501,16601,community_updates,und,Generic MHC Rules and Regulations,<p>Over the years many MHCO members have asked for a generic set of rules and regulations. &nbsp;Attached is a copy of a generic set for your review. &nbsp;Please be advised that any changes to &nbsp;existing rules&nbsp;will require following a process outlined in statute (ORS 90.610) for residents currently living in your community. &nbsp;MHCO&nbsp;has developed <strong>FORM 60</strong>&nbsp;to use when&nbsp;changing&nbsp;your rules and regulations. &nbsp;Your community rules are for you to develop and implement. &nbsp;Hopefully this set of generic rules and regulations will give you some ideas for where your rules fall short. &nbsp;<em><u><strong>Remember - all rules and regulations need to be implemented consistently and thoroughly.</strong></u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>,23,1,1537458623,1537459766,1,0,0,0,013504,16604,community_updates,und,Housing Affordability Bill Introduced in the US Senate,"<p>On September 26, 2018, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced S. 3503, the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which seeks to help bring down costs for renters and buyers and level the playing field so working families everywhere can find a decent place to live at a decent price.""""

This came from a General Landlord - Tenant Coalition, and not the Manufactured Housing Coalition. &nbsp;However, as a result of this law, MHCO Form 49 was changed to comply. This was an error, as manufactured housing tenancies were specifically excluded in the last subsection of the statute. This has been corrected, and the prohibition against raising rent within the first twelve months of a tenancy, has been removed. To date this does not seem to have been an issue, since most park owners do not routinely implement rent increase for their new tenants within the first year of their tenancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""rtejustify"">However, going forward, landlords with park-owned homes should remember that these are essentially subleases, to which the manufactured housing section of the law (ORS 90.505 et seq.) does&nbsp;<em><u>not</u></em>apply.

Obviously, November 1 will come and go without the completion of the sale.</em></p><p>Before we get back to the phone call from CASA, a few details that occurred after September 1 were not mentioned in the<em>fourth</em><em> part of this series</em>.</p><p>THE PAPERWORK PROCESS - The Cooperative requested an appraisal on Riverbend for the purpose of financing. An application for Capital Needs Assessment was required to fund the appraisal. Although this process was a few days late, this shouldn't delay the sale, if any, at all. The request for the appraisal was made on or around September 17. The completed appraisal was submitted to the State on October 16.</p><p>The appraisal, once completed, is the last and remaining document for the application process. The application then activates the underwriting process. When the State grants its approval of the underwritten application, it is then forwarded to the Oregon Housing Stability Council (HSC) for the final approval. So, who then gives the financing approval?</p><p>Grant agreements are then drafted and agreed to by CASA, the Cooperative and the Department of Justice for comments and approval of the funds needed to finance this purchase agreement. Once the agreement has gone through the many approvals and those signatures have been secured, the sale then gets the go ahead. The closing is all that remains.&nbsp;</p><p>PARK OPERATIONS - Always in the back of my mind in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter of each year is budgeting and my assessment for a need to increase the rent. Scheduled rent increases that I have asked of the tenants usually takes place on January 1. If the sale does not go through as expected, I will need to start in late September on implementing the increase.</p><p>All Oregon MHP landlords know that when they feel that they must increase their rents, that landlord will immediately turn to their Oregon Revised Statutes and go directly go to ORS 90.600. Those landlords will then be reminded that all tenants will need to be given a 90 day notification upon a landlords need for such an increase. In this case, I needed to get my notifications in the mail by September 26 to insure that the tenants did get their notices by September 30 in time for the January 1 implementation. (In Oregon, a tenant needs to be properly served via first class mail so that the notices are in their possession for the full 90 days before the rent is due).</p><p>My tenants were now aware that if I was still the owner of the community on January, their rents were now to be increased from $370 to $380 per month for the New Year. (Yes, that is the going rate of MHP rents in the small city). The request for the rent increase at the beginning of the year would become prophetic in more than one way.</p><p>Now we have an appraisal, capital needs assessment, an application, a submittal to the State for underwriting, approval by HSC for final approval, financing and finally approval by the Department of Justice, CASA and the Cooperative. And then we are ready for a closing on November 1. What could possibly go wrong???</p><p>Receiving the phone call from the Executive Director and Development Manager of CASA, they informed me that the events of their due diligence, application and approval process leading to a final sale was running behind their timeline. Their request was that we agree to and move back the closing date to March 1.</p><p>If you remember from the first part of this series, I wanted to sell this community for several reasons. I thought that the possible sale to the tenants would work for me because I was not going to exercise my 1031 option and I wanted to sell but didn't need to sell. The exemption of the State Capital Gains was another huge benefit that does not go ignored. I could wait when the purchasing party was ready.</p><p>I also mentioned in the first part of the series that my terms on selling would increase the Ernest Money by $10,000 per month for 2 months for any delay by the buyer for this sale.</p><p>CASA did want to delay the sale of the park back to March 1 because of delays of the process that the buyer needs to achieve in this process. It appears that the delay could possibly be with the Department of Justice. It has been suggested to me that the DOJ accomplishes its work on its timeline and doesn't have any kind of fast track program for this type of case. Whatever the delays were, the Ernest Money was increased by $20,000.</p><p>Then there is the case of my onsite manager. She has been there the entire 12 _ years that I have owned the community. She has spoken to me over the past 2 or more years about retirement and spending more time for herself and family. She does not want the responsibility of park management anymore. My agreement with my manager when I signed the Purchase Agreement was that she would work for me until November 1. This was extended another month, when the extension by CASA was requested. My manager still resides in the park and will continue to live there as a tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, I have also been in frequent contact with the Coop board President and the Treasurer about the status of the park. This can lead to problems of a conflict of interest here although the best interest of the Community is most important to both parties. I continue to speak with the onsite manager regarding the status of the park. When it is necessary to speak with the 2 board members, usually the conversation will swerve into the current status of the park and how some issues need immediate attention. With all that has occurred since the formation of the board for the Cooperative, I can honestly say that I have had a great working relationship with both the President and the Treasurer. Also adding that they, in no way, have acted in my behalf to take care of any issues that I have a need to accomplish. I have seen this as phasing out my current manager and bring in the new ownership.</p><p>I do look forward to closing this deal in that we have been working on this sale for almost 5 months. Now I look at this delay from another standpoint. We are getting late in 2018. Pushing this sale back into 2019 will make tax planning much easier in that I have more time to do that planning. In addition, the rent increase will be implemented on schedule on January 1. It became prophetic in that the $380 rent is the amount that the Cooperative will start asking its members upon closing.</p><p>It remains to be seen if this rent in the long run can be sustained by the Cooperative or if an adjustment of the rent will need to be made.</p><p>Now that we are targeting the close sometime in the first quarter of 2019, I can now anticipate enjoying the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But I also need to find the proper way to sell"" the 2 park owned homes to the ""occupants"" (not a complete legal description of the habitants) of those homes.</p><p>Recently",23,1,1548290449,1548290879,1,0,0,0,013550,16650,community_updates,und,Phil Querin Analysis of SB 608 (Rent Control),"<p>Attached is Phil Querin's&nbsp;detailed analysis of SB 608 (Rent Control). &nbsp;SB 608 will be up for a public hearing on Monday, February 4th&nbsp;at 3 pm. &nbsp;Information on written and public testimony will be forth coming early next week. &nbsp;</p>",23,1,1548608685,1548608747,1,0,0,0,013551,16651,community_updates,und,"Rent Control Hearing Monday, Februay 4th at 3 PM  Hearing Room 'B'","<div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Oregon Legislature has scheduled a public hearing on SB 608 (Rent Control - Elimination of No Cause Eviction) for Monday, February 4, 2019 at 3 PM at the Oregon State Capitol, Hearing Room 'B', Oregon Senate Committee on Housing.</span></div><div class=""e2ma-p-div"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8px;""><span class=""e2ma-style"" style=""font-size: 14px;""><strong><em><u>This is an ""all hands on deck"" for owners of manufactured housing communities.</u></em></strong>&nbsp; This legislative proposal has the potential to make grave changes to Oregon Landlord/Tenant law and is by far the most serious threat we have faced in the last two decades.

Riverbend MHP is a 39 space community located within the city limits of Clatskanie, OR.</em></p><p><em>The delays of the purchase by the state agencies approving the sale to the tenants were discussed in the fifth part of this series. The tenants want to push back the closing to possibly March 1 from an original target date of November 1. The author is told that the close will probably be around the middle of January.</em></p><p>The vacation we had planned with our sons and their wives was scheduled for February 16. We have just come into the new year with the signing of the final documents just a few weeks away.</p><p>The delay for the November closing date was due to the Oregon Department of Justice. However Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) also played a role in the delay.&nbsp;OHCS is&nbsp;Oregon's housing finance agency, providing financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. I was not aware of the specifics to the causes of the delays. As I learned later, the funding to Purchase Riverbend in Clatskanie came from several sources.</p><p>One other delay that occurred at the end of this process came from an easement that I signed with Charter Communications almost 10 years ago. That also needed to be addressed. That wasn't easy in that Charter's offices stretch from San Antonio to Southern California to Spokane. Backing out of an agreement that automatically renews every 3 years was not easy. The people at CASA worked with the attorneys at Charter to come to an agreement on either working with the existing agreement or outright termination of that agreement.</p><p>To complicate matters, CASA terminated its employment of their Development Manager. This was the one key individual that I relied on to guide this process and to be the main line of communication between myself and the Board of the new Cooperative. Now it doesn't look like the closing is not going to get done in January and I am coming close to a personal vacation deadline. That wouldn't go very well with my better half.</p><p>In late January, I was contacted by a contractor on a project that I started a year before. The riverbank at one end of the community started giving way which threatened a space with a home on placed on it. Where moving the home to another safe space would cost less than $15,000, this was much less that shoring up a riverbank at an estimated cost of 70 to 80 thousand dollars. My decision to move the home was obvious due to the costs of each of my options.</p><p>Apparently the Cooperative decided to pursue the bank stabilization project. Getting together with the Contractor's Project Manager, I signed the permits that I applied for to give that responsibility to the Cooperative. It would be the Cooperative's decision to explore the stabilization project. What is going through my mind is how would the Co-op be able to finance that project? Whatever that answer to that question is, the permits for the Army Corp of Engineers and Department of State Lands is now in the hands of the Cooperative.</p><p>CASA apparently settled their issues with the DOJ and OHCS to the point where the funds were secured. The sale was to occur. The date to sign at closing was set for February 14; two days before vacation. I was to meet the escrow officer in downtown Portland at 2:00 PM. To my surprise, the Board for the new Cooperative was also there having just signed the closing documents in the hour before I was to sign. Needless to say, they were very excited to make this deal as much as I was relieved to sign it away and move on myself. Now it is time to move on, and I couldn't be any happier.</p><p><strong>EPILOGUE</strong></p><p>During calendar year 2013, State Representative Nancy Nathanson asked the Landlord Tenant coalition to work out an agreement between the Tenants and Manufactured Home Park Landlords. To summarize the conversation of that entire year, tenant associations were to be given an opportunity to compete to purchase the communities where they live when an owner considered selling the community. Especially if that prospective buyer wanted to close that Park. The tenants wanted the opportunity to actively manage their property while gaining equity in the communities where they lived.</p><p>The Landlords on the other hand were leery of the information that would be divulged to the tenants, the time it would take for the tenants to form a Cooperative Board to explore the possibilities of a purchase and the possibilities of losing a sale to another private party that was to be based upon the IRS tax code of a 1031 exchange. Landlords were concerned that information that was gathered by the tenants could be used against them in social media or in legal proceedings if the tenants were unsuccessful in purchasing the community.</p><p>By the end of 2013 the Tenants and the Landlords were not close to an agreement on the issue. It was a confrontation that went to the legislature in the short 2014 session. This led to HB 4038A that was passed in February of that 2014 session allowing the tenants of a MH Community the opportunity to be forewarned of a potential sale and form a Board to participate in any bidding process.</p><p>Landlords were required to inform the tenants of their intent or at least their possible considerations as to the disposition of their community. It was most Landlord's feelings that in order to accommodate the Tenants, the time to agree with another private party that would use the 1031 option as part of the future transaction would be lost because time would be of the essence in this case.</p><p>The carrot on the end of the stick"" to the selling Landlord was the waiver of long term capital gains on the sale of the property.
