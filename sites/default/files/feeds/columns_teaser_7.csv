Four significant pieces of legislation passed over the weekend impacting manufactured home communities. The four bills are summarized below.  <em><u>In the weeks to come MHCO will be doing extensive articles on the legislation, forms will be updated and they will be covered extensively at the MHCO Annual Conference in Eugene October 28-29<sup>th</sup>.</u></em></p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16690,column,und,2019 Oregon Legislative Final Update - 4 Bills Pass Over the Weekend - Legislature Adjourns,"<p> It was a brutal legislative session that will always be remembered for the passage statewide rent control (SB 608).  Unconscionable that the majority party leaves opponents 90 - seconds to testify in opposing significant legislation after unlimited time for panel after panel of 'experts' in support.  When in power they all do it - Democrat and Republican - not a pretty thing to watch.</p><br><p>MHCO thanks everyone who made the effort to show up at the Capitol, e-mail legislators, call legislators, attended public hearings or attended MHCO 'lobby day' at the Capitol.  You help make our voices heard - we are very appreciative of your efforts and they did make a difference.  Thank you!</p><br><p>Before we get to the final Legislature Update of the 2019 Legislative Session here are two quotes to remember as we head into the post 2019 Oregon Legislative wilderness:</p><br><p><strong>Senator Shemia Fagan (D-Portland):</strong>  ""For many renters, for many families SB 608 (rent control) does not do enough or does not come soon enough and those voices are important too and I want to lift those up.  'Street Roots' (a weekly alternative newspaper establish in 1998 that is sold by and for the homeless in Portland)in it's editorial on Senate Bill 608 said, ""SB 608 is truly the least we can do.  So, legislators should pass it so we have a better benchmark and then we expect them to keep fighting."" <strong><u>... and I agree!</u></strong>  (Senate floor speech, February 12, 2019).</p><br><p><strong>Representative Julie Fahey (D-West Eugene &amp; Junction City):</strong>   ""This year, Oregon passed <a href=""https://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=37c9f7d4f6ce46d393fc67073&amp;id=b88cefa40d&amp;e=9f39e4c813"">SB 608</a>(rent control), an anti-price-gouging measure that will cap rent increases at about 10%. SB 608 will absolutely help mobile home park residents in Oregon, <strong><u>but I worry that 10% is still too </u></strong><strong><u>high</u></strong>for seniors on fixed incomes and low-income Oregonians.""(April 29, 2019 District Newsletter).</p><br><br><p><strong>Final 2019 Oregon Legislative Update (7-1-19)</strong></p><br><br><p><strong>SB 586C Landlord-Tenant Coalition Bill</strong></p><br><p>Covers 5 issues:</p><br><p>1. Floating home tenancies in marinas: Adds floating home tenancies in marinas to the programs provided by the Manufactured Communities Resource Center of the Housing &amp; Community Services Department  -  which will necessitate changing its name to include a reference to marinas  -  and requires that marina landlords, like MH park landlords, register with MCRC and get continuing education credits and pay the annual registration fee. It requires that marina tenants, like MH park tenants, pay the $10 annual special assessment (with their property taxes) that supports MCRC. And it makes other, related changes reflecting the special circumstances of marina living. </p><br><p>2. Sub-metering of water: Clarifies and simplifies the process for landlords to recover for the cost of water/sewer/storm water to encourage more landlords to switch to recovery for that cost other than through the rent. And to promote transparency and understanding by tenants, requires a landlord who wants to change the billing method to first meet with tenants and, for switching to sub-meters, to do a three-month trial billing period.</p><br><p>3. Dispute resolution and enforcement: Current law already provides for voluntary mediation of MH park landlord/tenant disputes through MCRC. The bill will allow the parties to invoke mandatory mediation. It provides that a landlord or tenant may require the other party to participate in at least one promptly-scheduled mediation session regarding most disputes  - </p><p>with some exceptions  -  involving landlord/tenant law before the filing of an eviction or other lawsuit. Mediations will generally be performed by the existing network of Community Dispute Resolution Centers. Enforcement: The bill also authorizes a four-year pilot program to provide legal representation to tenants  -  advice, negotiation, litigation  -  through an OHCSD grant capped at $100,000 per year. An advisory committee will monitor both elements and report to the 2021 and 2023 legislatures. Both the grant and the advisory committee have four year sunsets, 1/1/2024.. </p><br><p>4. Termination of tenancies; noncompliance fees: Improves the process for landlords to require cure of separate and distinct violations of a rental agreement, as consistent with law applicable in apartment landlord/tenant law since 2005, and simplifies and clarifies the termination statute language. Allows landlords to better utilize an existing statute regarding noncompliance fees. </p><br><p>5. Maintenance of trees on MH park spaces: Current law already allows landlords to maintain trees on a tenant's space to prevent a tree from becoming hazardous or from causingdamage or injury, after notice to the tenant. The bill requires landlords, in that notice, to specify which, if any, tree that the landlord proposes to remove, in order to minimize mistaken removals. </p><br><p><strong>HB 2164 A </strong></p><br><p>Extends several tax expenditures for six years: manufactured dwelling park capital gain subtraction, manufactured dwelling park closure credit.</p><br><p><strong>HB 2333 C</strong></p><br><p>Allows option to obtain title, but not registration, from Department of Transportation for recreational vehicle qualifying as park model recreational vehicle and meeting other criteria. </p><br><p>Provides that recreational vehicle having title issued by Department of Transportation does not qualify as structure. Requires owner to surrender Department of Transportation title for recreational vehicle if converting recreational vehicle to use as structure. Makes recreational vehicle converted to use as structure subject to state building code. Requires seller of new recreational vehicle to provide purchaser with written information listing specified living area systems. Requires that information state for each listed system whether items or components comprising system are covered by warranty and, if so, extent and length of warranty. Removes recreational vehicle construction from regulation by Department of Consumer and Business Services. Changes definition of ""recreational vehicle.""</p><br><p>This legislation will clarify the appropriate titling of park models that are quickly becoming an affordable means for providing housing for people throughout the State of Oregon.  There is currently no clear path for the titling of these homes from a governing agency.  Without the clear ownership documentation, lenders are reluctant to loan on the units so there is no current financing options for prospective owners/residents.</p><br><p><strong>HB 2896 B</strong></p><br><p>Directs Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) to establish a loan program for nonprofit corporations to support the preservation and affordability of manufactured dwelling parks. Specifies loan eligibility and preservation requirements for loan recipients. Requires OHCS to report to the Legislative Assembly each odd-numbered year. Appropriates $3 million from the General Fund for administration and funding of the program. Takes effect on 91st day following adjournment sine die. </p><br>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1562000430,1562000740,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13144,"<p>The Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) went into effect on March 12, 1989.

How soon do you recommend that we review and revise our criminal history policies?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Time is of the essence, said Williams, who believes that anyone with a broad generalized policy is at high risk for challenge. Certainly the larger your company, the more chance there will be that you could be challenged, so she believes it's a very smart practice for everyone - all companies - to take another look at their criminal screening policy to determine if it needs to be revised, and if so, to immediately go about taking the steps to do so.</p>",959,994,1580,16688,column,und,9 Q&As ON CRIMINAL SCREENING POLICIES - (Part 4 of 4),"<p><strong>Inaccuracies</strong> </p><p><strong>Question</strong>: What happens if a community denies housing based on a screening report that contains inaccurate information about an applicant's criminal history?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: When the denial takes place, Richer explained that it's the community's responsibility as a user of consumer reports under the FCRA to provide the applicant with an ""adverse action"" notice, which would direct him to the screening company that provided the information to the housing provider.</p><p>The applicant has the right to a free disclosure of the contents of the report and to dispute any inaccurate and non-updated information found within the report. The screening company then has 30 days to verify that the information is accurate and belongs to that consumer. If the information can't be verified, it would be removed from the report. The applicant would get a corrected copy of that report and could also request that a corrected version of the report be sent to the original inquirer (the community).</p><p>This is one reason for having a very active appeal process, Williams said. If you get the wrong person's record, which does happen occasionally, the appeals process allows the person to come forward and show that that is not his record and it was a mistake, and allow you to undo the rejection immediately.</p><p><strong>Look-Back Period</strong> </p><p><strong>Question</strong>: How far back should we go in considering criminal convictions? When should the look-back period start-on the date of conviction or the date the applicants left incarceration?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Depending on the status of the record (conviction, pending case, etc.), the look-back period date may vary, Richer said. The look-back period could start on the date of release from incarceration, but remember: That information may not be readily available in some states, so it can be challenging to base your look-back period on that particular date. You may want to craft a policy that includes multiple types of dates based on the information available from the criminal source, Richer said.</p><p>Every company needs to decide this for itself, Williams said, but you could include the date of conviction, and also the date of release-with the same or lower look-back period. For example, you could set the look-back period to be seven years from conviction of the crime, and three or four years from release from incarceration (or whatever number of years you choose). In states where you may have difficulty getting that data, Williams said that it will be something to work out with your screening company.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: How do we determine what is considered a reasonable look-back period?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: To determine a reasonable look-back period for your community, Richer recommends consulting with your legal counsel, your resident screening provider, and perhaps peer communities. Some of the recommended best practices include longer look-back periods for more serious crimes (that would include incarceration) and shorter look-back periods for less serious crimes or misdemeanors. Several AmRent customers have selected up to 20-year look-back periods for very serious crimes, seven to 10 years for serious crimes, and three to five years for less serious crimes.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: How would you handle convictions for serious crimes, such as murder or rape, when the recidivism rate is so low, but the danger posed of that low percentage of offenders is extremely high?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Many housing providers are considering the safety, reputational, and financial risk when making these decisions, Richer said. Although the recidivism rates for murder and rape may be lower than other crimes (according to some statistics), you'll have to determine what legitimate, substantial, and non-discriminatory interest would be achieved with a policy that restricts housing based on the reputational risk of admitting a person with one of these crimes in his past.</p><p>It may be prudent to apply a reasonable look-back period that includes incarceration time, Richer suggested. In addition, your individualized assessment process might consider the amount of time since release from incarceration, evidence of criminal events since release, housing and employment history, as well as rehabilitation programs. This particular category has been challenging for many communities to reconcile.</p><p><strong>Pending Charges</strong></p><p><strong>Question</strong>: What should we do if the criminal record shows there are pending charges against an applicant?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Pending charges are different from records of arrest, but Richer and Williams warned that they still should be handled carefully with respect to the new HUD policy guidance. One option would be to treat applicants with pending charges somewhat similar to the way you would treat them if they had a conviction on those charges. Serious consideration should be given to the risk associated with the criminal offense and the impact to the community. It can get tricky when the charges are not severe, so you should consult with your legal counsel.</p><p><strong>FAQ: Rehabilitation Program</strong> </p><p><strong>Question</strong>: If an individual has completed a rehabilitation program, should we allow residency?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Your company policy might consider rehabilitation program completion as one factor in your individualized assessment process, Richer explained. The completion of a rehabilitation program alone might not be sufficient to mitigate all the risk associated with a particular crime. You might also consider how long ago the crime occurred and if the applicant has committed other related or non-related crimes since the original crime or after the rehabilitation program.</p><p><strong>Conditional Approval</strong></p><p><strong>Question</strong>: Can a criminal background check be approved with conditions-for example, accepting the application, but with a condition that the applicant can't be arrested for that offense during the calendar year?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Accepting an applicant with conditions is one of the best practices suggested under the HUD policy guidance, Richer said. When considering whether to do so, you'll need to consider how you'll monitor future criminal activity and complete the eviction process once the applicant becomes a resident (all at a cost to you). Richer said you should consult with your legal counsel whether the benefit of this condition outweighs the administrative burden and costs of managing the enforcement.</p><p><strong>Postponing Access to Criminal Records</strong> </p><p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the reasoning behind the recommendation to run criminal reports after other screening has been completed?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: The thought process is if you are not ""viewing"" criminal records until other qualifying criteria have been met (such as credit, rental history, employment verifications, and the like), then you will reduce the number of times that you are disqualifying applicants for housing based on previous criminal histories, Richer said. You are also likely to reduce the frequency of individualized assessments, which are time-consuming, costly, and require judgmental review of the applicant's circumstances surrounding the criminal record.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1561386146,1561433823,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13579,"<p>Your community has a no-pets policy, but a maintenance worker reports that a resident has a pet dog in her unit.</p><p>When questioned, she says she's disabled and the dog is her companion animal but refuses to provide documentation that she has a disability-related need to keep the dog.</p><p>Soon after informing her that she must remove the dog, you receive notice that she filed a HUD complaint, accusing your community of disability discrimination.</p>",959,994,1580,16679,column,und,A Disability-Related Companion Dog? ,"<p style=""caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><b><span style=""font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">The Question: What Should You Do? </span></b><o:p></o:p></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">1.<span style=""font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">     </span></span></b><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">Nothing, it's obvious that her complaint is merely a ploy to get around your no-pets policy. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">2.<span style=""font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">     </span></span></b><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">Send her a warning that she's in violation of your community rules and that she must remove the dog immediately or face eviction proceedings. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">3.<span style=""font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">     </span></span></b><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"">Contact your attorney to determine how you should respond to the complaint. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p style=""caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><b><span style=""font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">The Correct Answer: C </span></b><o:p></o:p></p><p style=""caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">If you receive notice of a formal fair housing complaint filed against your community, it's best to contact a fair housing attorney to oversee your investigation, advise you on the proper response, and communicate with the HUD investigator on your behalf. </span><o:p></o:p></p><p style=""caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><b><span style=""font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Wrong Answers Explained: </span></b><o:p></o:p></p><p style=""caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">A.

First, to be clear for our readers, a ""security agreement"" is any agreement that serves as ""security"" on the property.  For example, a trust deed is recorded on real property, and secures the promissory note.  If the note is not paid, the holder can turn to the security, and sell it to satisfy the unpaid indebtedness.</p><p>Since manufactured homes are not real property, the document is different, but the concept is the same.  A Retail Installment Contract is defined in <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/83.510"">ORS 83.510(12)</a>. Its purpose is to retain a lien upon the manufactured home to secure a buyer's obligations under the contract. Form 2A informs the buyer that the seller/dealer is claiming a security interest in the home for the duration of the contract, and that in the event of default the seller/dealer will have certain remedies to foreclose and/or repossess the home. Upon a buyer's full payment and performance under the Retail Installment Contract, the seller/dealer is required to mail to the buyer good and sufficient instruments to indicate payment in full and to release all security rights in the home.</p><p>If the sale transaction is closed in escrow, there is nothing more for the seller to do to secure his/her security interest in the home, as escrow will submit the necessary documents to the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services.</p><p>However, if the seller/dealer does not close the transaction through escrow, they will have to perform the following steps themselves:</p><ol>	<li>Submit to the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) an application for an ownership document on behalf of the purchaser.</li>	<li value=""2"">The application must be on a DCBS-approved form, and include the following:	<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha;"">		<li>The year, manufacturer's name, model if available, and identification number for the home;</li>		<li> Any existing ownership document for the home or, if none, the homes certificate of origin or other document evidencing its ownership;</li>		<li>The legal description or street address for site where the home is  or will be placed;</li>		<li>If the home is sited in a manufactured housing community, the name of the community;</li>		<li>The name and mailing address of each person acquiring an interest in the home;</li>		<li>The name and mailing address of each person acquiring a security interest in the home; and</li>		<li>Any other information required by the DCBS by administrative rule.</li>	</ol>	</li>	<li value=""3"">If the seller/dealer is unable to comply with Sec. 2, above, within 25 business days of the sale/closing of the home, he/she must provide a notice of delay to the purchaser.

Example: If the tenant has an unpermitted pet or has someone living with him/her who has not applied for residency as a tenant do not accept rent if you are planning to give the tenant a 30-day notice of default.  As soon as you are aware of a violation give the appropriate written notice to the tenant.  If the notice is simply a warning asking the tenant to correct the situation it probably is safe to accept rent since you are asking the tenant to cooperate voluntarily, rather than actually terminating their tenancy.</p></div><div><br><p><strong><u>Rule 2.</u></strong>        Do not accept performance by a tenant if it varies from the terms of the rental agreement or Rules and Regulations.  If the rental agreement provides for a late charge after the 4<sup>th</sup> day of the month, you should not accept late rent on the 5<sup>th</sup> day or thereafter without assessing the late charge.  A consistent pattern of accepting late rent without assessing the late charge may be construed as a waiver of the right to do so later.  This is also true where you have not assessed it against one tenant and then try to assess it against another.</p><br><p><strong><u>Rule 3.</u></strong>        Unless you and the tenant have agreed otherwise in writing, you will waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent if you accept partial rent after issuing a 72 or 144 hour notice.  The reason is simple: Oregon law says that you may avoid a waiver and accept partial rent, if the arrangement is set forth in a written agreement signed by both parties.  Say, for example, that following issuance of a 72 or 144 hour notice to pay rent you enter into a written agreement with the tenant which provides that you will accept a partial payment of $100 on the 10<sup>th</sup> with the balance to be paid by the 20<sup>th</sup>.  If the tenant pays the $100 but fails to pay the balance on the 20<sup>th</sup> as agreed you may immediately file for eviction.  However, your written agreement with the tenant should also include an express provision that if the balance is not paid as agreed - no new 72 or 144 hour notice will be required before filing the eviction.  </p></div><p>                                                                                            </p><p><strong><u>Rule 4.</u></strong>        If you  have already issued a 20 or 30-day notice for violation of the park rules you may accept rent so long as it is prorated to the termination date specified in the notice.  Never accept a rent tender which extends beyond the period in the rules violation notice.  For example, if on May 15, you gave the tenant a 30-day notice which requires correction by June 15th, you should only accept rent from the  tenant  for the first  15  days of June.     Accepting a full  month's  rent  means  that  the tenant  has""bought"" the right to remain in the park for all of June - which is inconsistent with your demand that he/she cure the violation or vacate by the 15<sup>th</sup>.  If the violation notice is for 30 days and its delivery can be put off a few days it is recommended that it be issued on the first of the month so no proration would be required.</p><br><p><strong><u>Rule 5.</u></strong>      If you have filed an eviction against the tenant ""for cause""  you may accept rent beyond the period in the notice if (a) you give the tenant written notice that acceptance of rent will not waive your right to proceed with the eviction and (b) the amount paid does not extend beyond the date the rent is tendered.  You should not accept rent prospectively.  For example, assume that (a) your 30-day notice on May 15 expressly notified the tenant of your right to accept rent without waiver and (b) you filed an eviction on June 16<sup>th</sup>, and (c) on June 25 the tenant tendered rent up to June 25 - you could accept it.  In other words, acceptance of a tenant's rent solely for the period he/she has already been there will not constitute a waiver of the right to continue your eviction against the tenant.</p><br><p><strong><u>Rule 6.</u></strong>        You may serve a 72 or 144 hour notice of nonpayment of rent upon a tenant against whom you have already filed an eviction for cause.  This is expressly allowed by Oregon Law.  Although the statute does not specifically say so, it is strongly recommended that the amount sought in the 72 or 144 hour notice not demand payment for period beyond the date of issuance on the notice.  For example, if you filed for eviction on June 1 because of an uncured rules violation on June 8<sup>th</sup> you could issue a notice for nonpayment of rent - however, the notice should only demand rent for the first 8 days of June.  If you waited until June 25 to issue the nonpayment notice you would demand rent for the first 25 days of the month.</p><br><p>Admittedly, these rules can be confusing.  If you have any questions you should speak to an attorney familiar with landlord-tenant laws.  If in doubt, refuse the tenant's rent tender until you are absolutely sure that acceptance will not constitute a waiver of your rights.  If the defaulting tenant mails in a rent check for more than is acceptable based upon the above rules or places it in a drop box at the office it should be promptly returned within six (6) days.  Holding on to such payment beyond that time could give rise to the argument that you waived your right to proceed with the eviction.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1465327881,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13338,"<br><p>On July 26, 1990, President Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""). The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (""ADAAG"") were shortly thereafter developed to guide new construction and alterations undertaken by covered entities. The ADAAG establishes the minimum requirements for ""accessibility"" for disabled persons in buildings and facilities and in transportation vehicles. Your state may have passed parallel laws which may tend to increase the protection of individuals with disabilities, however, this article focuses on Federal ADA compliance.</p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16438,column,und,ADA Claims: How to Avoid Becoming a Target,"<p>An initial question a community owner might have is, ""How about my pre-existing community, does it need to comply with ADA issues?"" Answer: ""It depends."" If your community pre-dates the ADA statute, and the community has not gone through any significant renovations (determined on a case-by-case basis), then the community may be ""grandfathered in"" in most cases. However, there can still be considerations of ""reasonable accommodation"" and ""readily achievable barrier removal"" under the ADA that could require a community owner to make modifications to existing structures and to make existing buildings ""accessible"" to the disabled. There may be no ""grandfathering in"" under these provisions of the ADA. In addition, if the community has undergone substantial alterations/renovations, this could also trigger ADA compliance.<br /><br />The next question is whether a manufactured home community is a ""place of public accommodation."" The ADA defines a ""public accommodation"" to be ""a private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation."" Examples of places of ""public accommodation"" include: places of lodging; establishments serving food or drink; places of exhibition or entertainment; places of public gathering; sales or rental establishments; service establishments; stations used for public transportation; places of public display or collection; places of public recreation; places of public education; social service center establishments; and places of exercise or recreation.<br /><br />Does a manufactured home community fit under these descriptions? Based on discussions with ADA experts, the typical community does not appear to ""fit"" under any of the enumerated examples of a ""public accommodation,"" assuming the community's facilities are only open for the sole use and enjoyment of the community's residents, rather than the ""general public."" In some cases, however, a community's clubhouse and office could be determined to be ""public accommodations"" as they are generally ""opened to the public."" In addition, the community's office is necessarily ""opened to the public"" as persons, not otherwise residents of the community, are allowed in and, in fact, are invited in to inquire about available spaces and/or homes in the community.</p><br><p>If the community has ""public accommodations"" which have ""barriers"" to ""handicap access,"" then the next consideration is whether the ""removal of the barrier"" is ""readily achievable."" The ADA generally defines ""readily achievable"" as easily accomplished and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense. 42 U.S.C.S. _ 12181(9). Federal courts have developed several factors in determining what is ""readily achievable"": (1) nature and cost of the removal; (2) overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved; (3) number of persons employed at such facility; (4) effect on expenses and resources; (5) impact of such action upon the operation of the facility; (6) overall financial resources of the covered entity; (7) overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; (8) the number, type, and location of its facilities; (9) type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; and (10) geographic separateness, administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity. <em>Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v. Hermanson Family Ltd. Pshp.</em> The community however will bear the ultimate burden to prove that the barrier removal is not readily achievable. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis for each individual community.<br /><br />So, how do you lessen the chance of your Community becoming a ""target"" of an ADA lawsuit? There are no ""bright lines"" as to whether a community has ADA issues or not. Since an ""ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" the prudent community owner might be best served by hiring a knowledgeable ADA Consultant to review and comment on whether the community has any ADA issues and how they should or could be addressed. Another, and more conservative approach would be to simply make sure that all of the community facilities are ""ADA compliant,"" even if, technically and legally, you may not be required to do so. Little things can make a big difference in your community. Examples of ADA compliance include: levers on the entrance doors; levers on bathroom doors and fixtures; bathroom fixtures at proper height; proper bathroom accessories; doorways that accept wheelchair access; bathrooms that accept wheelchair access; counters at correct height for wheelchairs users; alternatives (ramps/elevators) to steps into the clubhouse and office; acceptable transitions (no lips) at doorways (interior and exterior); handicap community and van access; acceptable transitions (commonly referred to as ""curb cuts"") to sidewalks at street junctions and handicap community; and acceptable inclines from community areas to public accommodations, to name a few.<br /><br />Your ADA consultant can walk your community and let you know what facilities do and do not comply with ADA. Making the necessary improvements will be money well spent, and potentially ""ward off"" expensive litigation, which litigation, in all probability, will not be covered by your general liability insurance policy. You might also want to turn this into a ""PR plus"" for your community - i.e., tell your residents about the improvements after they are done! However, such actions may not be right for every community. The community owner should first discuss ADA considerations with its legal counsel to determine what the right course of action under the particular circumstances.</p><br><p><em>Rob Coldren is a founding partner of the MHI-member law firm of Hart, King &amp; Coldren in Santa Ana, Calif.

If you add in those already aged 65 years or older, the number of these senior households grows to 60 percent. According to METLIFE Insurance Company, a large percentage of these heads of households will be grandparents. Due to economic necessity, many grandparents will be financially supporting their children and grandchildren, including having their children and grandchildren live with them. At the other extreme, 20 percent of these seniors will be living alone (this jumps to 38 percent of seniors over the age of 75). Because their children delayed having children until later in life, more of these seniors living alone also will have grandchildren who visit frequently.</p><p>Approximately 35 percent of Americans over the age of 65 rely almost entirely on Social Security payments for income, with the average Social Security benefit for a retired worker in 2011 about $1,177.00 per month.

I'll start you off with the verbose preface to Pader's paper:</p><p>THE PREMISE</p><p>""Attempts to define family and the appropriate sociospatial arrangements for an idealized ""normal"" U.S. household formation have had profound influences on the design and size of houses, apartments, and communities throughout the twentieth century. Based on ethnographic, historical, social, political, and legal research, this paper explores the sociopolitical construction of occupancy standards...  It concludes that the regulations drive from a combination of upper-class English ideals and outdated scientific knowledge, with concomitant moralistic and assimilationist aspirations on the part of the policy makers. Today, these social ideals still implicitly underlie much of our current urban design, affecting the ethnic, racial, and economic structure of cities, and by extension, homelessness, coercive segregation, and access to services.""</p><p>THE CONFLICT</p><p>""The conflict at the base of this article is how we define and conceptualize housing discrimination on the basis of national origin and by extension...  familial status...  This inevitably leads to an exploration of how mundane daily practice and macrolevel social policies are inextricably entwined with one another. The daily practice in question here is sleeping arrangements...  This directly influences where households with restricted means and more than four or five household members can live.</p><p>I am retheorizing the definition of ""national origin"" away from its legal definition of the place of origin of one's self or one's ancestors - and toward an anthropological definition of what it means to be from...  a particular geographic locale. This means reframing the standard question derived from the 1949 Housing Act which set the goal that all citizens should enjoy ""a decent home and suitable living environment."" Thus, rather than asking ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have equal access to decent housing?,"" I ask ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have the same opportunity to decide for themselves what they consider acceptable and preferred living arrangements, and, therefore, have equal access to decent housing?""</p><p>... The basic questions are: What is the basis and justification for current standards - which are generally some variation of no more than two people per bedroom? How did this ratio become normalized and win over three people per bedroom, for instance; and why did bedrooms come into the talk of restricting occupancy anyway? Even culturally mediated definitions of what should be counted as a bedroom have found their way into codes and legislation. How did occupancy standards come to be such a bone of contention?</p><p>... This is not a call to remove occupancy standards altogether and return to the severely densely populated and ill-kempt tenements of early 1900s New York City; this is a call for a reappraisal of currently accepted standards.</p><p>... Debates around regulating occupancy standards place us firmly in the blurry jurisdictional boundaries between courts and Congress. Here, I will walk in that blur as I draw on some of the social, cultural, historical, political, and legal data that make up my argument as to why most current occupancy standards should be deemed illegal... </p><p>... Current occupancy standards and their rationales are historical and cultural artifacts that have been accorded the status of universal truth. ... The basic strands of my argument...  are:</p><p>First: The general justification for current standards presume [they are] reasonable to the<br />ordinary person. If I can demonstrate that they explicitly derive from, and refer to, upper-class,<br />English and Anglo-American definitions of reasonable, and that definition is in fact unreasonable to<br />many of the ethnicities in the U.S. exactly on account of where they or their ancestors are from and<br />what it means to be from there, then surely the prevailing definitions of ""ordinary"" and ""reasonable""<br />categories lose their privileged positions.</p><p>Second: The standards tend to be further justified under the rubric of providing for the health, safety, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants. I argue that it is not [what] is being protected by the 2:I standard as purported. Rather it is a very specific, culturally constricted definition of moral health, safety, comfort and convenience. This is not to argue that less restrictive occupancy standards would similarly have no legitimate physical health, safety, and comfort rationale.</p><p>What is crowded to some is exactly what is comfortable to others; what is comfortable to some is<br />exactly what is lonely to others. Such differing reactions to spatial relations are largely the consequence of socialization and cultural practices, with implications beyond occupancy standards (Werner , et al., 1997).</p><p>[It should be noted that it] ... is not just people who cannot afford more who share bedrooms. In countries as different as Mexico and China people commonly choose to share bedrooms while leaving other bedrooms unused. In a demographic study of household density in the U.S. using 1990 census data, researchers found that Latino and Asian households often have more than two people per bedroom even when their income is the same as White and Black households of the same size, again suggesting choice is at play, not economic necessity (Myers, et.al, 1996).</p><p>... Sharing household space with extended family members is a common way of living throughout much of the world, and a common way of getting through hard times, or even strange times such as first entering a new country. I have often been told when I have interviewed people from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, a home full of kin is not considered crowded as long as there is room on the floor.</p><p>... [And], what might have been justifiable on health grounds early in the twentieth century...  has become antiquated due to modern medicine and technology. ... I often wonder what current policy-makers would say if they knew that their health and safety rationale was based on nineteenth century concepts about miasmas and vitiated, or impure air. This cutting edge scientific knowledge of the late nineteenth century proved, without doubt, that one's own breath was full of deadly carbonic poisons and that some 40% of deaths in New York City were directly caused by breathing one's own self-inflicted noxious air - you could drown in your own exhaled breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876). This led to the perceived need to ensure the right combination of ventilation for dispelling the poisons to match the number of people in an enclosed space.</p><p>THE HISTORY</p><p>... [W]hile the occupancy standards might be facially neutral, that is they are equally applied to everyone across the board, their effect certainly is not, and their intent often is not either.</p><p>... In large part, occupancy standards derive from the tenement conditions of 19th / early 20th century New York, the Lower East Side in particular with its densely populated immigrant households. As Social Darwinism was losing clout, other ways of denigrating the humanity of the largely Jewish, Polish, Italian, and Slavic populations were taking its place. It must be remembered that each of these non-WASP ethnic groups was considered a separate race; they were what historian David Roediger (1991) calls the 'not-yet-white,"" a concept with significant implications here.</p><p>Turn of the century urban tenements were pretty miserable. No one was responsible for cleaning the<br />streets, buildings tended to be dirty, dark, poorly maintained, and often unsanitary (DeForest and<br />Veiller, 1903; lanes, 1876; Lubove, 1962; Veiller, 1910).</p><p>... Like public and low-income housing today, there is a conflation of the now decrepit physical environment left to deteriorate by the government or private landlords with the moral character of the inhabitants. ... I wonder, should it be the character of the people who leave the housing to deteriorate, not the residents who have to live in that decrepitude, that is conflated with the condition of the property?</p><p>[For h]ousing reformers - who came from the middle- and upper-class establishment - ... [t]he dominant belief of the era was that bad housing conditions, including too many people per unit according to their standards of uncomfortable crowding, directly produced illness, crime, intemperance, promiscuity, and the breakdown of the family. Their goal was to bring order to what they considered to be disordered, and thereby dangerous. The reapportionment of domestic space was one step in the orderly Americanization of these not-yet-white immigrants.</p><p>A 1905 survey [found] about 50% of the apartments housed three or four people per room, while 25% had five or more people (Takaki, 1993). The fairly new discipline of Public Health fought for the first building codes in New York State in 1867 through their organization, the American Public Health Association (APHA). They wanted to contain the spread of contagious disease, both within the slums and from moving uptown. Improving physical health was only one part of their mission; improving what they assumed to be a lapse in moral health was more important for justifying the push toward assimilation through restructuring domestic space, and in particular, sleeping arrangements.</p><p>... [W]hat constituted overuse of sleeping rooms to the Reformers (and most rooms were sleeping rooms in the tenements) was lack of physical privacy. The ability to gain privacy by having one's own physically bounded space to sleep and think, was by now perceived as an essential necessity for healthful living. Too many people sharing, children sharing bedrooms with their parents, and of course, sharing with lodgers,<br />almost inevitably means that there can be no provision for privacy or decency, and results in<br />sexual precocity and in many cases promiscuity, which may, of course, in time lead to a<br />criminal record. (Gries and Ford, 1932:xx)</p><p>This clearly articulated environmental deterministic view from the 1932 reports of President Hoover's Commission on Housing and Home Ownership is no different than the earlier views of [other] reformers. Ironically, these moralists did not consider that many people in a room was a form of surveillance which might even mitigate sexual abuse. If any sleeping arrangement is to be suspect...  it should be private sleeping rooms with their closeable and lockable doors.</p><p>THE STANDARD</p><p>... The first occupancy standard in the U.S. was enacted in 1870 [in] San Francisco [and] required a minimum of 500 cubic feet of air space per person. However. it was disproportionately enforced in Chinatown where low-paid, single, working Chinese men had no choice but to share rooms with less air space each than mandated. In 1876 California made this minimum a state-wide law.</p><p>... In 1879 New York City passed its first occupancy standard. It required 600 cubic feet of air space per person. This derived in part from the scientifically ""objective"" belief in miasmas and vitiated air, that one's own breath contained poisonous carbonic acids. It was believed that without a minimal amount of space and renewable air, people could literally drown in their own breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876). By 1901 this was decreased to 400 cubic feet for each adult and 200 for each child, still with an underlying, scientific health justification.</p><p>These early...  laws provide an important caution: Where does the line between caring for the plight of others and discrimination lie? It is not always a clearly defined or overt line. When does the desire to improve material conditions of the disenfranchised run a collision course with ethnocentrically derived moral platitudes?</p><p>... The reformers of the Progressive movement were largely responsible for getting occupancy standards enacted in order to improve the slum conditions and did at least replace the prevailing genetic interpretation of why certain groups predominated in many northern urban slums, with an environmental determinist interpretation, which is a step up.</p><p>... Progressive concerns with the design and use of low-income immigrant housing were not simply<br />altruistic. ... Overcrowded and unsanitary apartments in urban neighborhoods also made 'productive' living very difficult (1988:82). ... housing was seen as an important political tool, to enhance both assimilation and worker productivity.</p><p>The emphasis on physically bounded privacy as a moral and even political good was part of the turn<br />of the last century public discourse. Thus, in a 1905 speech, United States Commissioner of Labor,<br />Charles P. Neill pronounced that:</p><p>[H]ome, above all things, means privacy. It means the possibility of keeping your family off from other families. There must be a separate house, and as far as possible separate rooms, so that at an early period of life the idea of rights to property, the right to things, to privacy may be instilled. (Wright, 1981:126)</p><p>... In the 1939 publication, Principles for Healthful Housing, the [American Public Health Association] wrote:<br />'A room of one's own' is the ideal in this respect; but we can at least insist on a room shared<br />with not more than one other person as an essential minimum. Such a room should be occupied only by persons of the same sex except for married couples and young children. The age at which separation of sexes should occur is fixed by law in England at 10 years, but some American authorities would place the figure 2 years lower. Sleeping-rooms of children above the age of 2 years, according to psychiatric opinion, should be separate from those of parents. (p. 16)</p><p>... The British Act was explicitly a basis for the American Public Health Association's (APHA) reports<br />entitled Standards for Healthful Housing. [These] then became the basis for the standards adopted by HUD and non-governmental standards creating agencies since the 1950s.</p><p>... In 1950 the APHA published: ""privacy in the home should be one of the fundamental objectives of<br />design...  (p. 15-16)."" They also published a confession of sorts: The minimum occupancy standards necessary to attain the goal of ""healthful housing ...closely approximates actual practice in the high- income groups"" (1950: xx, italics added), making explicit that one sector of society, the high-income primarily white northern European Protestant, had become the marker for all.</p><p>... the home design guidelines found in HUD's handbooks and most housing codes reiterate and help maintain certain culturally acceptable notions of proper personal and social behavior. The same culturally imbued structural principles about privacy, privatization and proper moral behavior underlying the 2:1 codes guide the standard definition of a bedroom: ""a bedroom cannot be a passthrough to another room"" (HUD, 1985:6-5).</p><p>... Conflated with this are questions of whether ""a room used for sleeping"" has to be a room labeled as a bedroom, and whether any non-passthrough which is not for instance, a bathroom or kitchen, can be counted as a bedroom for the purposes of establishing maximum occupancy. The ambiguity here is at the basis of much legal and political action.</p><p>[An unpublished 1940 paper for the APHA explicitly states], ""The health justification is to prevent interruption of sleep, but the moral argument is more commonly used"" (APHA Archives).</p><p>... These statements explicitly and intentionally privilege one culturally specific lifeway, discriminating<br />in the creation of the standards against people with different preferred modes of living, and against<br />Iow-income families with children.</p><p>... These seemingly neutral and healthy sociospatial relations found their way into the child raising dictates of a person who highly influenced how many of us were raised, Dr. Spock the baby doctor.<br />Starting in the late 1940s, and continuing into later editions of Baby and Child Care, he wrote that<br />children should ideally have a room of their own ""where they can keep their own possessions under<br />control and have privacy when they want it."" (1976:201)</p><p>In the 1980s, another great arbiter of American culture, Dear Abby, wrote in What Every Teen Should Know: Youngsters ""need a room to retreat to"" in order to help them grow as individuals...  (Van Buren: n.d.).</p><p>... [The moral argument] is based on the U.S. emphasis on individualism objectified in the continual reiteration of the necessity of physical privacy within the home to attain a particular concept of physical, psychological, and social health. As I have suggested, in societies which value and practice interdependency, in which individualism and physical privacy are a punishment, a form of alienation, not a goal to be desired, one commonly finds house plans and social and spatial relations which correlate with and reinforce the concept of interdependency rather than independency (Pader, 1993).</p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</p><p>Various municipalities and policy-makers are trying to change the local occupancy codes to limit the number of people who may live in a unit...  Not surprisingly, it is whoever are the current unwanted populations, the not-yet-white populations, that these codes are being used against.</p><p>For instance, in 1992, Brisefio v. the City of Santa Ana, the lawyer for Mr. Brisefio claimed the city<br />had racist intentions and was trying to rid the city of the growing number of people of Mexican origin (Brisefio v. City of Santa Ana, CA, 6Cal. App. 4th 1378 1992). The judge feared that the impact of<br />the proposed ordinance would be greater homelessness and could find no compelling reason to permit the city to have a more restrictive policy than the state. Other municipalities have passed restrictive occupancy policies and then lost them in court.</p><p>IN SUMMARY</p><p>... My point then is not to suggest that people from some ethnic groups prefer to be packed like herrings in a barrel. Rather, it is to set a stage for less ethnocentric, more culturally inclusive occupancy standards. Of course most people would like to be in a position to choose whatever size home they want, and then choose for themselves how to apportion the space - maybe by giving each person their own physically bound private space, or maybe by sharing all spaces with immediate and extended family, or maybe some other configuration altogether.</p><p>In conclusion, I argue that what we are talking about here is not physical and psychological health and safety as the codes are supposed to protect, but moral health and safety from the perspective of early 20th century upper-class and mostly northern European reformers, transposed and naturalized into the late 20th / early 21st century policies, and priorities about individualism, privacy, personal property, the body, responsibility, and social justice among other beliefs. Then, they were explicit about their rationale. Now it is just accepted as natural behavior.</p><p>And it is the people brought up to believe in the lessons of individualism through privately possessing one's own space, as psychologically and physically essential for health, who write the policies, and who decide what is, indeed, reasonable to the ordinary person - and who decide what that ordinary person looks like. In actual number, I would guess that the ordinary person they are talking about is in the minority, leaving out most ethnic groups, of all colors.</p><p>... What is needed is more discussion about reframing the definition of national origin to include what it means to be from a particular geographic locale within the context of understanding the intimate connections between social and spatial relations in the home, at the levels of the individual, the household, and of the larger society of which they are a part. And then to accept the preference for sharing as equally legitimate as the preference for privacy. To do less than this is being complicit in discriminatory housing policies.</p><p>... Sometimes I wonder what current debates would look like if the dominant mindset was [different]. Would more people be housed? Would extended families and large families have greater opportunity to select where they want to live? Would apartment developers move from the current trend of emphasizing two-bedroom units (which under current regulations tend to have the effect of eliminating many families with children) to larger ones to allow more nuclear and extended households to find housing of choice?""</p><p>I told you Ms. Pader was loquacious!

This lack of familiarity can result in significant liability to park owners.  Here is a short primer:</p><br><p><strong><em>Screening Criteria. </em></strong>The manufactured housing section of Oregon's landlord-tenant law provides that any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser who will live in the community should be disclosed in the existing resident's rental or lease agreement.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> Although those conditions must be in conformance with state and federal laws, there are no limitations or restrictions as to what criteria may be placed in the rental or lease agreement.</p><br><p>If you are changing your screening criteria for existing residents, you may be in violation of Oregon law, since those criteria are supposed to already be in the rental agreement, which, as you know, cannot be unilaterally amended by a landlord - subject only to specific exceptions.</p><br><p>MHCO's rental and lease agreement forms contain a number of criteria that landlords may impose, such as:  (a) prior rental references; (b) unsatisfactory credit history or <em>no </em>credit history; (c) character references; (d) criminal history; (e) insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly space rent and other expense obligations imposed by the rental or lease agreement; (f) the presence, number and size of pets; (g) age verification criteria if the park is a 55+ facility; (h) evidence of falsified or misleading material information; (i) refusal to sign a written lease or rental agreement; (j) additional occupants; and (k) adverse public record information. </p><br><p>Note that in 2013, the Oregon Legislature changed the law as it relates to ""criminal history.""  Now, landlords and managers may not summarily reject a prospective tenant for ""any"" criminal history. Today, it is limited to:</p><br><ul>	<li>Pending criminal charges, or</li>	<li>Prior criminal convictions, if they resulted from crimes that are:	<ul>		<li>Drug-related;</li>		<li>Against persons;</li>		<li>Sexual in nature;</li>		<li>Fraudulent in nature; or</li>		<li>That could adversely affect the property, health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the landlord, landlord's agents, or tenants.</li>	</ul>	</li></ul><br><p>To remind landlords and managers, MHCO will be adding these clarifications to its rental and lease agreement forms. In the meantime, landlords and managers should adhere to the new limitations described above.</p><br><p>Although there may be other criteria that landlords and managers may wish to use when deciding whether to accept an applicant, the above list in the MHCO form is very comprehensive, and should be sufficient in imposing adequate guidelines when a resident wishes to sell their home on site.  If you want to make a change by adding additional screening criteria, you may only do so for new residents coming into the community - not retroactively for existing residents.</p><br><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms.  Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check providing necessary verification.  Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day or 10-day period<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does <em>not</em> prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees.  Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day or 10-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted application if it is incomplete - and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned. Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided incorrect information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion. </em></strong>Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes. Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly can result in the process becoming rushed.  Landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws when one applicant claims they were treated differently than another.</p><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Although the law provides that the screening criteria must be in the rental or lease agreement, they may also be found in the rules and regulations.

The 85 to 94 year-olds experienced the fastest growth between 2000 and 2010. The senior age group is now, for the first time, the largest in terms of size and percent of the population in the US.  While the overall senior population has increased, there are major social and financial differences within the group.  For example, the Baby Boomers were young adults during the 1960's and are therefore a more ""free thinking"" group than their parents, the 85-94 group. While the Baby Boomers generally are not cookie baking grandmothers, they still require specific attention to their needs.  Socialization is a key component for any successful senior living community program, but Baby Boomers are not interested in Bingo.  The Boomer generation is driven and ""self' centered.

Will the product we build today be desirable or outdated in 5, 10, 15 years?  Why do we insist that seniors should live in small apartments with no dishwashers?  Why do we expect seniors to dispose of all their possessions to live in one of our units with 600 square feet?  My sister turned 55 last year, and if she were to move into a typical senior community, she would expect the amenities she has always had.  <em><u>Senior housing is not just for little old ladies anymore!  </u></em>The rules of the past may not apply to this new generation of seniors. Boomers have already shown signs of not following their predecessors in the products and services they desire. They will work longer (don't skimp on parking places) prefer to age in place (smart floor plans, upgraded interior appointments, green features), 89% of seniors are on-line at least once a day (think Wi-Fi, not computer classes), and desire more active retirement scenarios (think wine tasting rather than a quilting bee). For example,  on site movie theatres, a concierge (not ""activities director""), opportunities that reflect current social trends (golf, gardening, cooking, decorating), concerts with varied options, a technology driven entertainment center (think XBox, not shuffle board) are just some ideas of how to attract the new generation of seniors. Remember, ""Oldies"" are not just Frank Sinatra and Doris Day, but the Beatles and The Stones! </p><br><p><strong>Financial </strong><strong>Issues</strong>We are living a decade longer than our parent's generation due to healthy aging and increased access to healthcare.  Although this would seem to be a welcome fact, there are many seniors who live with the very real threat of running out of financial resources to sustain this longevity.  Nearly half a million elderly living alone in California cannot make ends meet. These seniors lack sufficient income to pay for a minimum level of housing, food, health care, transportation and other basic expenses.  ""As the economy wipes out retirement savings and destroys home equity, our parents and grandparents will find paying for a roof over their heads and affording basic necessities even more of a struggle"", said Steven P. Wallace, Ph.D, Center of Human Policy Research.  This research shows that elder economic insecurity is problematic in both more and less affluent counties.  A majority of all single elders aged 75 or older are economically insecure.  The numbers of affected seniors are likely to be even higher as the current recession deepens. So what do we do?  It may be a reasonable accommodation to change the rent due date to allow for the changing dynamic with assistance payments. All resources should be explored in order to keep the senior in their housing with eviction as a last resort.</p><br><p><strong><u>Mental Illness </u></strong>affects one out of every five seniors in America.  Just a handful of significant mental health problems that may occur are delirium, dementia, depression, and schizophrenia.  Older adults who suffer with mental health conditions often have very abnormal behavior and patterns that create a decreased capacity for them to function independently.  In many cases, mental health problems in seniors are too often ignored by health care professionals and attributed to ""old age"".  Traditionally, our culture does not show any type of respect or dignity for those suffering from mental health disease.  As our population ages, this challenge will become more prevalent. Many of our residents relocated to California and left their families to pursue the ""golden dream"".  This has left them alone in their elderly years, and they look at us to fill that role for them.  Our roles as rental housing professionals will need to evolve into a position of being able to locate resources that can provide assistance to our aging residents. This is why partnering with various social service agencies is such a vital component to add to our amenities on senior communities.  </p><br><p><strong><u>So, how do we support the staff? </u></strong>I believe that there is a special place in property management heaven for our staff members that contribute to the success of our senior communities!  We depend on these employees to provide customer service on a completely different level.  The demands of the senior resident are wide and varied... .""why does that animal live here?"" ""I do not like the looks of my neighbor""; ""She is looking at my husband?"" ""Why can't you take me to the store? '_.etc.  Our responses must be kind but firm, and conversations must be conducted in terminology that seniors understand. Many seniors believe that the management of our communities have a greater responsibility to them - this makes sense if we keep in mind that they have owned their own homes for many years and probably had some resistance to moving into a ""retirement home"" that they may think is Assisted Living.  Their sense of entitlement runs deep after so many years of being valued and contributing members of our society. Employees are challenged with understanding the perspective of the senior resident.  We need to provide major support to these employees and provide continual education on how to interact with seniors.  A little pampering and wide shoulders to cry on wouldn't hurt either!</p><br><p>Professionals in the senior housing industry provide a vital service that goes beyond housing.  We provide care, comfort, and a sense of family to our residents. This population segment will only increase so as an industry we need to get ahead of the trends and prepare for the influx of senior residents that will come our way. Our senior consumer wants reasons to believe, not empty facts.  They want an emotional connection that goes beyond the walls and floors.

It isn'. Having under market rent loses you money every month. If the property ever goes on the market, it will sell for less and maybe a lot less. Today a tenant isn'tgoing to move because the rent goes up to market. Most tenants know what the rents are at other mobile home parks (often having better market rent intel than the owner). They won't be surprised when the rent goes up to market. If the owner is doing a good job of operating the mobile home park, higher rent won't be cause to move. When doing a rent increase, include the rent survey for your market, showing the rent charged at other communities. Also, be sure to factor in the water, sewer and garbage, if included in the lot rent. The water and sewer are probably $30 - $60 per month per house- hold, depending on the city, and the garbage is probably $9 - $15 per month per occupied site. If you are paying for these, consider how you may pass these utilities through. Be sure to factor in an estimate of water, sewer and garbage for the owners that pay it or the tenants.</p><p><strong>Mistake #2: Rent Survey </strong></p><p>What should the rent be? Not that many owners do annual rent surveys. If you have a manager, that should be their job. If there are owners of multiple mobile home parks in your market, look to their rents as a benchmark of the real rent. After all, these companies have to report earnings to shareholders or investors. They can't succeed by charging above market rents.</p><p><strong>Mistake #3: Holding On Too Long </strong></p><p>When you have a park owned home that isn'tselling, it's time to let go, and get it sold or rented. Anyone that has been in this industry for a while and sells homes knows what it feels like to have an unsold mobile home that sits month after month with no offers. You market it, keep utilities on, pay insurance and cleaning, the staff shows it countless times and nothing. It's time to cut the price (ouch!) or do whatever needs to be done to sell the home. Each month that passes is another month of rent you'll never recover.</p><p>The same thing is true for mobile home park ownership. Sometimes the mobile home park property looks great on paper. After you actually own it, you find it's not your cup of tea. Maybe it's too far away from your office, the demand for homes isn'tgood, or a major employer shuts down, to name a few reasons why investors sell a mobile home park. In Warren Buffet's 2014 Letter To Investors, he freely writes about big mistakes he made early on with Berkshire Hathaway; mistakes that might have been deadly for the company. In fact, the Berkshire company (a textile company) which became the Berkshire of Berkshire Hathaway, closed 18 years after Mr. Buffet acquired it, and he writes, ""During all of those 18 years, we struggled unremittingly, all to no avail. But stubbornness -stupidity-has its limits....I finally threw in the towel and closed the operation."" Mr. Buffet goes on to say that he knew the Berkshire company acquisition ""... was a mistake. Having committed much of (the company's) resources...I quickly compounded the error by continuing to invest in a business that eventually became the most costly of my career."" If the Sage of Omaha can admit to millions of followers that he blundered, then perhaps business owners and investors should take a page out of Mr. Buffet's playbook and cut the cord when something isn'tworking, be it a park owned home OR a park.</p><p><strong>Mistake #4: Financing </strong></p><p>There is a lot of refinancing and new loan action today. Why? The low interest rates plus the threat of rising interest rates are the reasons. The Federal Reserve has been making noise for what seems like years, about increasing the interest rates. As the economy improves and the jobless recovery continues to dissipate, the</p><p>Federal Reserve finally raised interest rates in late December of 2015. Not all lenders are the same though, and finding a lender, whether it be local, regional or national will make a big difference in both the amount financed (dollars to you!) and the ease of the transaction.</p><p><strong>Mistake #5: Records </strong></p><p>Today there is truly user friendly and effective software for mobile home parks. I use Rent Manager and so do a lot of other mobile home park owners. For your own peace of mind do yourself, your accountant, your manager and a buyer a big favor, and invest in good software (it's not that much money). A couple of years ago, I hired a property manager with no accounting background. She took to Rent Manager like a duck to water. My accountant is also a big fan. don't be intimidated by upping your game with great software.</p><br><p><strong>Mistake #6: Survey, Phase I and Appraisal </strong></p><p>Once upon a time, when you acquired your property, you might have had the property surveyed, appraised and a Phase I (California) environmental assessment done. If you didn'torder these reports, whoever you bought from may have left them in the office or the survey may have been recorded. Try checking with the county recorder or county engineer. These re- ports will save you money and time if you ever need to update them, or your heirs or a buyer require them. It's faster and cheaper, for example, if the land surveyor has an existing survey to start with.</p><p><strong>Mistake #7: Water and Sewer </strong></p><p>Please do something about this, both for your cash flow and the environment. These pesky leaks can be tough to find. Some of the large owners use American Leak Detection (Google it -they have regional offices). They are not cheap, but they will find your leaks and fix them. Water leaks are expensive; it is money you won't ever recover. One time I sold a mobile home park where the owner knew he had a water leak to the tune of about an extra $2,000 per month. This was a small mobile home park. When he sold the park, a condition of the sale was to find the water leak(s) and fix them. By then, he really wanted to sell his park because his company (not the mobile home park business) was growing and the business re- quired his full attention. The upshot was that after losing at least $40,000 in water costs he hired two companies (the first company didn'tfind it) about $3,000 to find the leak and another couple of thousand for the second company to fix the leak. The moral of the story is that you will never get back the wasted water bills, so it's best to bite the bullet and find and fix the leaks. _Ê</p><p>Joanne Stevens is a real estate broker specialist in listing and selling mobile home parks and manufactured home communities throughout the U.S.</p><p>She can be reached at 319.378.6785 phone; 319.365.9833 fax; and email: joannestevens@ joannemstevens.com</p><p><strong><em>This article was recently published in WMA's February 2016 ""Reporter"".

This doesn't cause quite as much heartburn for property owners who have wisely passed such utilities through to the residents to pay in addition to their rent. However, for the overwhelming majority of properties, particularly those which were developed prior to the 90's, the rent charged typically includes any combination of utilities including water, sewer, garbage, and to a lesser percentage electricity, natural gas, cable television/satellite, and internet services.</p>",959,994,1580,16012,column,und,Bill Miner RV Q&A,"<p>From one year to the next, the only certainty one can realistically expect is that rents will need to be adjusted just to keep pace with the utility increases that are coming one's way from the various providers. The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs? Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies. We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services.</p><p>Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year. Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin. This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent.</p><p>A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense. You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption. This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption. Rates are high now and will continue to rise. A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities. All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility.</p><p>You need to be aware that your business is under attack. Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges. As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice: 1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment. This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list. The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing. The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees. Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing. The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"". I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity. The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law.</p><p>Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent. Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"". This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges.</p><p>One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states. We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another. Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide. Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense. Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board.</p><p>If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents.

In it was included the company's screening requirements, as well as what was apparently their stock occupancy standard for all units: ""Maximum occupancy of no more than two (2) persons per bedroom.""</p>",959,994,1580,16022,column,und,Can You Afford to Keep Utilities Included in Your Rent?,"<p>There is a growing body of case law across the country in which housing providers - both landlords and condo / homeowners' associations - have lost cases in which they've had two-people-per-bedroom policies. At this point, we have not seen a housing provider loose a case with a two-plus-one policy1, so long as it takes into account other factors such as the overall size of the unit. The recommendation we're seeing come out of these cases is that housing providers ought to thoughtfully consider a separate occupancy standard for each, individual floor plan, based on several factors.</p><p>The Fair Housing Council has put out more than one article on occupancy standards and related fair housing implications (available at <a href=""http://www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm"">www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm</a>) but this is a topic that continues to come up in classroom sessions and Hotline questions. Having also just read a couple stunning reports detailing the legal and historical context for occupancy standards, I thought I'd dive back into the subject anew to reiterate fair housing cautions and share some very illuminating information.</p><p>What follows is the first in a two-part series detailing research and commentary by two occupancy policy experts and fair housing advocates. In this article, we'll look at the work of Tim Iglesias of the University of San Francisco School of Law as he explores the legal implications and disparate impact of overly restrictive occupancy policies, including two people per bedroom. In the next article, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst provides revealing historical and cultural perspectives behind our country's occupancy policies.</p><p>THE PROBLEM<br />Tim Iglesias states clearly that ""overly restrictive private ROS [residential occupancy standards]...  substantially reduce the housing choices... Demographic trends and the prolonged economic recovery which prompts more doubling-up promise this issue will only grow in importance."" What's more, there are profound societal fair housing implications, regardless of individual intentions.</p><p>Iglesias proffered some suggestions to the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in a document entitled Recommendations to HUD Regarding Application of the FHAA2 to Residential Occupancy Standards. In it he states that, ""the two-person-per-bedroom standard discriminates against families. New empirical evidence demonstrates that this finding applies to substantial proportions of studios and one-bedroom apartments..."" He sites a study that ""found that families with children run afoul of the standard more than ten times as often as other households. Ten percent of families with children live in one-bedroom units, and nearly three-quarters of those families exceed the two-person-per-bedroom standard.</p><p>In addition, regardless of the type of unit to which it is applied, the two-person-per-bedroom standard has a disparate impact across racial lines. National studies show that the proportion of African Americans excluded by this occupancy standard is statistically significantly higher than for whites; the proportion of Asians excluded is higher than the proportion of blacks; and the proportion of Hispanics excluded is the highest of all. Indeed, more than one-third of all Hispanic children living in one-, two-, or three-bedroom apartments in the United States in 2007-2009 would have been displaced by rigorous application of the two-person-per-bedroom standard. Overall, the study found that when applied the two-person-per-bedroom standard substantially limits the housing choices of many thousands of families, especially Latinos, Asians and extended families.""</p><p>Iglesias asserts in a 2011 Memo to Fair Housing Advocates that, ""[t]his problem is particularly acute in nicer housing in neighborhoods with attractive amenities (e.g., good schools, access to shopping, jobs and medical care).""</p><p>He also explains that two-person-per-bedroom, ""has a dubious origin:<br />1. There is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard was calibrated in any way to be a standard which presumptively avoided discrimination.<br />2. and, the two-people-per-bedroom standard predates the 1988 FHAA, which was intended to be remedial legislation to address previous discriminatory practices against families.<br />3. ... research examining the historical origins of the two-person-per-bedroom standard has found that it was neither scientific nor otherwise objectively grounded, but merely the product of classist and ethnocentric paternalism.</p><p>According to Iglesias, ""there is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard is necessary - much less uniquely suited - to protect landlords' reasonable interests.<br />1. Rather, [it] is merely the housing industry's traditional standard.<br />2. It's really a prophylactic policy that errs widely on the side of protecting landlords' interests and is not designed to avoid discrimination.<br />3. Moreover, in jurisdictions where FHAPs [Fair Housing Assistance Programs] employ a ""two-persons-per-bedroom-plus-one"" enforcement guideline, there is no objective evidence that landlords using this more generous standard have suffered any so-called ""overcrowding effects.""</p><p>""Arguments that the two-person-per-bedroom standard has legal force are weak. Even if the Keating Memo3 has some legal force, it would be the whole memo, not the [two-person-per-bedroom] standard standing alone."" The memorandum ""provides that a two-person-per-bedroom standard is ""presumably reasonable"" (ambiguous but apparently meaning presumptively compliant with FHAA), but that all private residential occupancy standards are subject to a multi-factor analysis to determine whether or it violates the FHAA.""</p><p>THE HARM<br />The problems with overly restrictive occupancy policies are numerous, leaving a multitude of households with few options. Many are harmed as they are forced to ""reconfigure their household composition,"" as Iglesias puts it, ""[and] split up and deprive its members of their desired living situation. Splitting up the family can conflict with deeply held cultural preferences / norms to live closely as a way of life and to keep together the intergenerational family, the extended family, or both.""<br />If unwilling to ""reconfigure its composition,"" then the family must either:<br />- secure more housing than desired which imposes additional costs,<br />- accept inferior quality housing, such housing often poses health risks to residents or<br />- accept an inferior location,  '_typically in an area with worse schools, more crime, and decreased access to jobs, transportation, shopping, and other amenities. Cumulatively, movement to these inferior locations increases economic and racial segregation.""</p><p>""Finally, the denial of housing choice by the application of a restrictive residential occupancy standard may also constitute illegal discrimination."" Iglesias goes on to site a multitude of cases that reference the discriminatory harms incurred by ROS3.</p><p>THE JUSTIFICATION<br />Why do landlords impose ROS? Iglesias asks then answers the question:<br />1. ""They do this for a variety of reasons. Some are legitimate some of the time, but they are often overstated. And landlords have a hard time documenting a clear and direct linkage between a legitimate business reason and a particular ROS.<br />2. Landlords' traditional arguments for imposing a ROS are summarized by the phrase ""overcrowding"" and include:<br />a. preventing a variety of economic costs caused by so-called ""overcrowding,"" including concerns about future property value and profits, increases in ""wear and tear"" costs... , extra expenses for utilities and garbage, increased (risk of) damage to the property, increased insurance costs, and increased management costs;<br />b. preventing nuisance-type harms to other tenants and neighbors from ""overcrowding,"" including noise and increased demands for parking;<br />c. to promote often paternalistic concerns about the habitability / quality of life of tenants, including the safety and appropriateness of facilities for children and purported psychological harm to tenants from living in ""overcrowded"" spaces, and<br />d. to avoid overtaxing the carrying capacity of one or more systems of the housing unit (e.g., water or sewage).""</p><p>THE PROBLEMS WITH THE KEATING MEMO<br />Iglesias argues that HUD's enforcement practices have enabled the two-person-per-bedroom standard to become de facto law, but that new empirical evidence demonstrates this standard is often discriminatory. Part of HUD's implicit involvement includes what was issued as an internal document from a HUD staff, Mr. Keating, but which has come to be seen as an endorsement of two-people-per-bedroom policies. (You can view the Keating Memo and subsequent guidance from HUD at <a href=""http://www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm"">www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm</a>.)</p><p>As Iglesias notes, ""[s]ometimes defendants seek to use HUD's Keating Memorandum as a ""defense"" of two-person-per-bedroom standards because the Keating Memo states that this standard is ""presumptively reasonable."" While many courts have made reference to the Keating Memo and the two-person-per-bedroom standard, no court has ever properly analyzed whether it owes any deference to the Keating Memo. Even if the Keating Memo is due some deference, such deference would be to the whole memo including its factors analysis... ""</p><p>The Keating Memo is problematic for many reasons, including its use of the two-person-per-bedroom standard as ""presumptively reasonable"" and its lack of clarity in how to apply the factors it advices housing providers to consider, such as the size of bedrooms and the unit, the configuration of unit, other physical limitations of the housing, state or local law, and other relevant factors.</p><p>Iglesias notes that, ""any private residential occupancy standard - including two-persons-per-bedroom - is subject to review using the factors stated in the [Keating] memo...  [T]he misunderstanding among many that the Keating Memorandum provides a ""safe harbor"" for landlords who impose a two-person-per-bedroom standard"" has caught a growing number of housing providers by surprise.</p><p>Among other things, Iglesias urges HUD to ""adopt a regulation to define the appropriate liability standard and defenses and to establish a true safe harbor for landlords. The Keating Memorandum provides a useful form for this standard, but specifics need to be worked out."" He goes on to theorize that ""[i]f studies were conducted, they are likely to show that 2.5 people per bedroom or 3 people per bedroom is a more appropriate safe harbor, at least for studio and one-bedroom units. The Keating factors must be further specified, e.g. setting the square footage of a regular-size bedroom and defining when additional habitable space requires allowing additional occupants.""</p><p>Check back here for the next in this two-part series.

For example, a housing provider might limit a two bedroom-home to five individuals. This ""two plus one"" formula can help insulate the housing provider from fair housing violations based on occupancy in most situations. That being said, additional factors should always be considered in developing individual policies.<br />2 The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 coupled with the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 protected the following classes in a housing: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (children), and disability. Oregon law also protects marital status, source of income, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors. Washington law covers martial status, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors, and honorably discharged veterans / military status.

The park is a ""55 or older"" facility, and neither the son or girlfriend met the park's age requirements.  More importantly, the son's presence in the park was accompanied by constant visitor traffic at all hours of the day.</p><br><p>The park issued a 30-day, for-cause notice to the tenant after confirming that the son and girlfriend were indeed staying there.  At trial, the judge believed the evidence that the son was staying in the home, but took issue with the park's overnight guest policy.  The judge found that the rental agreement policy allowing only 14 overnight visits per year was ""unconscionable.""  The court stated that the limit was ""unreasonable, obscure, and empowers Landlord excessively to Tenant's detriment.""  The judge went on to consider other factors in deciding the case, but an underlying theme was that tenants should be allowed more time for guest visits.</p><br><p>As a trial court decision, the case does <u>not</u> establish a legal precedent on overnight guest visits.  However, while each case is different, landlords could limit their potential liability by expanding overnight visits above 14 days per year.  Based on this particular judge's opinion, a 21-day per year limit might be a good safeguard.  This adjustment could help negate the ""unconscionable"" argument by establishing a more relaxed guest policy. </p><br><p>If your park rules already allow more than 14 overnights per year for guests, it would be wise to rely on that policy to enforce guest visits.  If you choose to amend your existing guest policy, mobile home park landlords can do so by issuing a rule change notice under ORS 90.610 (MHCO Form 60.)  Non-park landlords can implement a new guest policy by having tenants sign off on a new guest policy rule.

Title III governs places of ""public accommodation"" and affects certain areas of mobile home and RV parks.  In a nutshell, a ""public accommodation"" is any place to which the public is invited.  For a typical mobile home park, this would at least include the leasing office, the parking lot for the leasing office, and an accessible pathway connecting them.  These are ""pubic use facilities.""  If a mobile home or RV park has short-term (i.e. daily or weekly) RV space rentals, the entire park could be considered a public accommodation, in which case the park would need to comply with the ADA. </p><br>",959,994,1580,16344,column,und,Complying With ADA Requirements for Public Accommodations,"<p>           Among other things, the ADA requires public accommodations to make <em>new</em> public use facilities fully accessible, to remove physical barriers for older ones (built before January 23, 1993) to the extent ""readily achievable,"" and to make any ""alterations"" to existing public use facilities accessible to the ""maximum extent feasible."" </p><p>            Many park operators mistakenly believe that <em>none</em> of the park is a public accommodation.  Many also incorrectly assume that they are ""exempt"" from the ADA's requirement because their leasing office and parking lot facilities are very old.  As a result, they fail to make the leasing office and parking lot accessible, and make themselves vulnerable to ADA complaints or lawsuits.</p><p>            An existing public use facility that was built before January 23, 1993 must remove physical barriers to entering and using the facility, such that it can be navigated by a disabled person, when ""readily achievable.""  Whether changes are ""readily achievable"" will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in light of the <em>resources available to a public accommodation</em>.  Thus, a park owned by a large company with substantial resources will clearly be expected to have removed most physical barriers to entry into the leasing office and to use of the parking lot (and any other areas of the park to which the public is invited).  A small mom and pop mobile home park may be expected to at least have taken all of the relatively inexpensive steps to make the leasing office and parking lot (and any other areas of the park to which the public is invited) accessible.      </p><p>            Examples of ""readily achievable"" barrier removal items include (but are not limited to): installing ramps; making curb cuts at sidewalks and entrances; rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, etc. so that disabled persons can access the public area; widening doorways; and installing grab bars in toilet stalls if a public bathroom is offered.</p><p>            When an existing, older public accommodation decides to start working towards barrier removal, it should keep four priorities in mind.  Most importantly, the first priority should be to make changes to ensure that disabled persons will be able to get ""in the front door.""  For example, a mobile home park would need to remove stairs that a person must navigate to enter the leasing office so that someone with a mobility impairment could access it.  The second priority should be to provide access to areas where goods and services are available.  The third priority should be to provide access to restroom facilities.  And, finally, the fourth priority is to take any ""other measures"" necessary to provide access to the public accommodations' goods, services, and advantages. </p><p>            Public accommodations should keep in mind that when working on barrier removal, they must comply with the alterations requirements of the ADA's Accessibility Guidelines.  Those Guidelines set forth specific ways that curb cuts, parking areas, grab bars, etc. must be installed.  If it is not ""readily achievable"" to fully comply with the Guidelines, a public accommodation must take steps that <em>are</em> ""readily achievable.""  For example, if a doorway cannot be widened quite enough to comply with the Guidelines, the public accommodation would still be required widen the doorway as much as possible. </p><p>            If a public accommodation builds a <em>new</em> public use facility, that facility <em>must</em> be made readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.  The new pubic use facility must follow the ADA Accessibility Guidelines' architectural standards.  Similarly, if a public accommodation makes ""alterations"" to its pubic use facilities, those alterations must be accessible to the ""maximum extent feasible.""  For a mobile home park, if the park remodels its leasing office, the leasing office would need to comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines as much as possible.  If undertaking a remodeling project in any part of the mobile home park that is open to use by the general public, the park should consult with a contractor well-versed in ADA compliance. </p><p>            Again, RV parks with short-term (daily and weekly) rentals are particularly affected by these laws.  Generally, such an RV park will probably be considered a public accommodation as a whole.  Therefore, RV parks with short-term rentals should consult with contractors well-versed in ADA compliance to determine what can be done to make the park ADA compliant.  ""Readily achievable"" steps to remove architectural barriers will need to be taken.  Many RV parks are aware that several groups have been filing lawsuits targeting RV parks that do not comply with the ADA.  Some of these lawsuits have focused on parking lots, but others have focused on the facilities as a whole-for example, whether the park has a pool lift.  Some of the groups filing such lawsuits have ""testers"" who will make a phone call to the park and ask whoever answers the phone questions about whether the facility has certain ADA accessible features.  It may be wise to simply invite those individuals to take a look at the park rather than answering any specific questions about accessible features.  It is unwise to say that you do not have a pool lift or that your bathrooms are not accessible. </p><p>            A final note of importance for both mobile home and RV parks: the pool.  A pool may or may not be a public use facility depending upon who has access to and use of the pool.  In a mobile home park or an RV park only doing monthly and longer leases, if the pool is only open to park residents, their visitors and guests, it is probably not a public use facility.  If the park, however, holds regular parties or events at the pool to which the public is invited, it probably will be treated as a public use facility and the pool is required to have a permanent pool lift or pool lifts meeting accessibility criteria.  RV parks with daily and weekly rentals are required to have a pool lift.     </p><p>            To enforce the ADA, private parties may file lawsuits to obtain court orders to stop discrimination.  While monetary damages are not available in such lawsuits, reasonable attorneys' fees may be awarded to the plaintiff if he or she prevails.  Additionally, individuals may file complaints with local enforcing agencies, like the Arizona Attorney General's Office (or in Oregon, the Oregon Attorney General's Office).  They will investigate complaints and, if they determine that a park violated the ADA, they are empowered to file suit.  In lawsuits brought by the AG's Office, monetary damages and substantial civil penalties may be awarded to the prevailing party.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;""><span style=""font-size:14px;""><font face=""Garamond"">Melissa A.

The first thing to realize is that the HUD guidance isn't intended only for HUD program housing providers, explained Richer.</p><p>Industry experts agree that the guidance provided by HUD applies to all housing providers, not just those receiving federal funding. The best practices are being recommended, so that any housing provider that uses criminal histories in its applicant screening process will consider disparate impact and review its criteria, adjusting as necessary, she said.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16683,column,und,Conducting Background Checks - Criminal History Selection Criteria Best Practices (Part 2 of 4),"<p>It's also important to realize that there isn'tone source for information on all federal and state criminal records, said Richer, explaining what she considers to be the ""biggest myth in resident screening."" There is no single ""national"" database of criminal records available to screening company providers. In fact, even the FBI database doesn'tcontain all criminal records from every court or state criminal repository in the country.</p><p>The way most professional screeners obtain data is either to use a third party or gather their own criminal records from state, county, and local sources, Richer explained. Either way, there are states that restrict the release of electronic criminal records, and some that omit personal identifiers, like full name or date of birth, which makes the process of matching records impossible.</p><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> It's difficult to gather criminal records because each source has a different way of cataloguing records. Those differences can make it challenging for both screening and housing providers to conduct criminal records screening.</p><p><strong>Understand Key Terminology</strong></p><p>Before getting started, you should understand some key terms used in criminal record screening. If you review criminal records as part of your application process, being able to clearly understand the disposition of the record is critical in how you evaluate prospects for housing, Richer said.</p><p><strong>Arrest</strong>: This word can be confusing or misinterpreted in the context of resident screening. Records of ""arrest"" refer to when a person is ""picked up"" or ""cuffed"" for a criminal event. He or she may be taken into custody (typically to a local police station), but a case has yet to be filed in a court. Richer said that most screening companies don't include records of arrest in their criminal background service.</p><p><strong>Pending case</strong>: Once sufficient evidence has been presented, typically the prosecutor will file charges. The charge filed opens a case at the appropriate court and the case remains pending until a final disposition, such as guilty or dismissed, has been rendered. HUD's new guidelines warn against making housing decisions based on arrests, so it's important to distinguish between arrests and charges filed (that is, pending cases).</p><p><strong>Disposition: </strong>Disposition refers to how the case was resolved in the criminal justice system. Any criminal record that isn'tpending would have some type of disposition.</p><p><strong>Deferred adjudication</strong>: Some states use the term ""deferred adjudication,"" which is a criminal record showing conviction status, but the court had ""deferred"" the conviction to allow the offender to participate in some type of community service program. If completed, the conviction status would be removed; if not, the conviction status would stand.</p><p><strong>Conviction:</strong> A record of conviction means the case resulted in the offender either pleading guilty or being found guilty.</p><p><strong>Look-back period</strong>: This refers to the amount of time a company will consider when evaluating criminal histories. You may have different look-back periods, depending on the nature and seriousness of the crime.</p><p><strong>Exit from incarceration</strong>: The date of exit from incarceration, parole, or release date if the sentence included jail time.</p><p align=""center""><strong>TIME OUT!</strong></p><p align=""center""><strong>What You Should Know about the FCRA</strong></p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;"">The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is the main compliance law for all screening providers (known as consumer reporting agencies), Richer explained. This federal law provides guidance and obligations for screening providers, users of consumer reports (including housing providers), and consumers (including housing applicants).</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;"">Once the criminal records are obtained, screening providers can only deliver the information in accordance with FCRA requirements. Here are some key things to keep in mind about the FCRA:</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>Permissible purpose</strong>: To gain access to any consumer report (including criminal records), companies must certify a permissible purpose under the FCRA. For housing providers, the one that typically applies is ""a legitimate business transaction initiated by the consumer."" You also may have the written consent of the consumer.</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>Obsolescence reporting standards:</strong> The FCRA defines how long a record can be delivered on a consumer report. The federal FCRA allows for records of conviction to display indefinitely; records of non-conviction (pending, deferred adjudications, and the like) are limited to seven years.</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>State law limitations</strong>: There are 11 states with different reporting standards from the federal FCRA. Most limit records of conviction to seven years, but some have different rules. For example, Kentucky limits records to only convictions, but keeps the time frame the same as the federal FCRA. And California, New Mexico, and New York only allow for records of conviction and limit the time to display to seven years.</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>Accuracy requirement</strong>: Consumer reporting agencies must have reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. For example, if a criminal record does not contain enough information to match to an appropriate consumer (typically full name and full date of birth), then it shouldn'tbe delivered in a consumer report.</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>Adverse action</strong>: If you determine that an applicant isn'tsuitable for housing, or you decide to offer housing with a conditional offer, based on the consumer report, then a ""statement of adverse action"" is required under the FCRA.</p><p style=""margin-left: 30pt;""><strong>Disclosure and dispute</strong>: The statement of adverse action directs the applicant (the consumer) to the ""source"" of the consumer report (the screening company) to find out what information was delivered to the housing provider (the user) and dispute any inaccurate or non-updated information. This is a free service to consumers and is required under the FCRA.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1560264731,1560264731,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13581,"<p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""> This is the first of four articles on the legal and practical considerations for housing providers when developing a criminal history screening policy.

The first and most common is to show intentional discrimination-what's known as <em style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">disparate treatment</em>. In these cases, the issue is whether people in similar situations were treated differently, and if so, whether that different treatment was due to that person's protected category.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The second is what's known as <em style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">disparate impact</em>. It's used to challenge a housing policy that on its face is neutral-that is, it doesn'tappear to favor one protected category over another-but when the policy is applied, it has a significantly negative impact or effect on one protected category. These cases are always based on statistical analyses using either national or local data, Williams said. It's this second category that was the focus of HUD's new guidelines on criminal background checks.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">To illustrate why the use of criminal screening policies have been causing such concern, Williams cited a recent study showing racial disparities in the criminal justice system. According to the study, one in every three black males born today can expect to go to prison at some point in their lives; this compares with one in every six Latino males, and one in every 17 white males. ""Racial minorities are more likely than white Americans to be arrested,"" according to the report. ""Once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once convicted, they are more likely to face stiff sentences."" The conclusions of this and other similar studies have resulted in a bipartisan effort to improve the criminal justice system to remove this apparent racial bias.</p><h3 style=""line-height: 1.1; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(3, 134, 94);""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">Overview: HUD General Counsel Announcement</strong></h3><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In a nutshell, HUD's new guidelines explain how the agency will evaluate fair housing claims based on the disparate impact that criminal background screening policies may have on racial and ethnic minorities. Williams explained the three-step process:</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">Step 1</strong>: The plaintiff must prove that a community's neutral criminal history screening process has a significant disparate impact on African Americans and Hispanics. The plaintiff could be an individual, an advocacy agency, a testing agency, or an enforcement agency like HUD or the Justice Department. To satisfy this step, the plaintiff needs statistics showing that African Americans are arrested and convicted of crimes at a significantly higher rate than whites using local or national statistics. In most cases, it's not difficult to provide these statistics. If the evidence ends, the plaintiff wins.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">Step 2:</strong> Then it's up to the housing provider to identify a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory business interest accomplished by the policy. One obvious reason is to improve safety and security, but HUD warns that bald assertions based on generalizations and stereotypes aren'tenough. It takes more than a personal preference to screen out all ex-offenders to justify a criminal screening policy-you'll need some statistical support for your policy. If the evidence ends, the housing provider wins.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">Step 3:</strong> In the final step, the plaintiff gets another chance to win the case with proof that a different policy would meet the interests of the housing provider but do so with a much less discriminatory impact. This is where the content of your criminal history screening policy can be challenged unless the policy is narrowly tailored to meet the ultimate purpose of the policy-to protect safety, for example-without denying housing to many applicants with a criminal record who may not actually pose a risk to your property.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">The bottom line</strong>: To defend your policy, you'll need to show that it accurately distinguishes between criminal conduct that indicates a demonstrable risk to residents' safety-and conduct that does not. For that, you'll need to consider statistics about recidivism-that is, the likelihood that a person convicted of a particular crime in the past is likely to be re-arrested for another crime in the future.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">As an example, Williams cited a study showing that the likelihood of re-arrest following release from prison goes down over time. Although nearly half of the subjects were rearrested, it was much more likely to happen during the first few years after release. By the end of the eight-year study, arrest incidents dropped down to the point where the percentage of those re-arrested was close to anyone else-including those without a past criminal record.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Another example was a report on the kinds of crimes most often committed after release from prison. In that study, the most common felony resulting in a re-arrest was assault-at 24 percent-and the least were rape and homicide, at less than 2 percent each.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">You don't have to become a criminal justice expert as long as you understand that disparate impact cases rise and fall on statistics, Williams said. These and many more studies are available to plaintiffs when challenging criminal history policies, so you should take them into account when reviewing your own policies.</p><h2 style=""line-height: 1.1; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 30px; color: rgb(3, 134, 94); text-align: center;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">TIME OUT!</strong></h2><h2 style=""line-height: 1.1; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 30px; color: rgb(3, 134, 94); text-align: center;"">Statutory Exemptions from Fair Housing Liability</h2><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px 40px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">When evaluating your criminal background screening criteria, consider the ""statutory exemptions"" from fair housing liability:</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px 40px; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">Manufacturing and distribution of drugs</strong>: Applicants with criminal convictions related to manufacturing and distribution of controlled substances as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act can be excluded.

Of course you can use them to screen prospective applicants, right?  You may be surprised.</p><br><p>The use of criminal background checks in the residential housing rental and lease application process has recently become a hot button issue.  Back on April 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing And Urban Development's (""HUD"") General Counsel issued a 10-page memorandum on ""Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related Transactions"" (""Guidance""). </p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16518,column,und,Criminal Background Checks - HUD's Published Perspective,"<p>According to HUD, criminal background checks have a disproportionate impact on minority home seekers, largely due to disproportionate conviction and incarceration rates for minorities and others in protected classes.  HUD's Guidance memo identifies methods of 'proof' that are used when analyzing a fair housing claim in the context of a housing provider who denies an applicant tenancy based in whole or in part on a criminal background check.  .</p><br><p>In other words, even though tenancy is not denied based on direct discrimination against the applicant as a member of a protected class (race, religion, nation origin, etc.), background checks that reveal convictions could nevertheless, in HUD's view, have a disproportionately negative effect (disparate impact) on members of protected classes resulting in a discriminatory housing practice.  HUD actually isn'toutlawing use of criminal background policies, but rather is aiming to prevent landlords, including Parks and Communities from using the background check information since use of these policies if that use ultimately has a discriminatory effect on people in a protected class.</p><br><p>HUD's New Guidance memorandum will certainly impact use of criminal background checks since many manufactured housing communities may learn that their own current policy on how to use applicant screening procedures may expose them to liability. This article will discuss two things:  (1) how HUD evaluates denials based in whole or in part on use of a criminal background check; and (2) factors a community should keep in mind when formulating or employing a policy about criminal ""history"".  </p><br><p>All communities are unique, and so too are the legitimate interests that a community must protect.  A community's size, location, and its age all play a direct role in corresponding issues regarding safety, security, and/or criminal activity.  A community's  initial decision to even use a ""criminal background check"" policy in the first place rests largely on whether the policy will further that community's interests, be it safety, security, or crime prevention, and ultimately enhancing the living environment for all residents. </p><br><p>By and large, all communities share core interests. Among these are screening out financially unqualified applicants and minimizing risk to community residents by applicants convicted of recent violent crimes, drug related crimes, and/or crimes involving children,.  Of course, the specific interest in maintaining a criminal background check policy varies depending upon the nature and characteristics of the community that justify the purpose.</p><br><p>If your community uses a ""criminal background check,""here's how the typical scenario goes: Applicant seeks to lease a space, submits the required application with supporting documentation, and answers ""yes"" to having a prior felony conviction.  Owner denies the application, on the conviction.  Applicant, now angry, lodges a fair housing complaint alleging the community discriminated against him/her.  Once that complaint is assigned, here's the 3-step analysis HUD will use to address the claim:</p><br><p>Step 1: The applicant must prove the background check policy has a discriminatory effect, meaning the policy results in a disparate impact on a group of persons in a protected class.  Said applicant need only prove the policy ""actually or predictably results"" in a disparate impact.  This will usually involve an extensive investigation of community residency applications reflecting a criminal conviction.</p><br><p>Step 2:  If the applicant satisfies step 1, the community must then show the background check policy is <em>justified</em>, meaning the community must show: (a) that it has a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest for screening an applicant's criminal background; and (b) running the criminal background checks achieves or furthers this interest. </p><br><p>Step 3:  If the community establishes that the policy furthers a substantial interest, the burden shifts back to the applicant to prove the community interest could be served by another practice with a less discriminatory effect.</p><br><p>Simply put, it's a game of ping-pong with some vague standards of proof.  So, what should communities do?  Well, if you screen criminal backgrounds when deciding if an applicant qualifies, you should ensure that your policy stays within HUD's newly published requirements.  Review your policies with your legal counsel to confirm this.</p><br><p>At a minimum, a community should keep the following important points in mind.</p><br><p>First, arrests are not sufficient.  An actual <em>conviction</em> is required.  There are also big differences between misdemeanor convictions v. <em>felony</em> conviction.</p><br><p>Second, blanket tenancy prohibitions for <em>all</em> convictions is not wise.  Rather, a policy should focus on (1) <em>what</em> the conviction was for (i.e. nature and severity of the conviction); (2)<em> when</em> it happened (i.e. how much time has elapsed since the conviction, as recidivism risk decreases gradually); and (3) the applicant's post-conviction actions, particularly rehabilitation efforts.  Keep a policy objective, with distinct standards. </p><br><p>Third, criminal background checks may be best when implemented as a final step in the application process, after a rental history overview, a credit check, and references.  There may be applicants who do not meet a community's standards based on these other criteria, meaning a criminal background check may not be needed.</p><br><p>While HUD guidelines are national and set a base standard, some states may further regulate the application process by statute, meaning a community must comply with stricter standards.  As always, it is important to work with your legal counsel to ensure you comply with specific standards applicable to your state.</p><br><p>No community wants to be on the receiving end of a discriminatory housing claim.  To avoid the potential pitfalls of a ""criminal background check"" policy, communities should develop and employ policies in close consultation with legal counsel.</p><br><p><em>Ryan Egan is a litigation associate with the Southern California law firm, Hart King, and is a member of the firm's Manufactured Housing Industry Practice Group.

These would include local schools, community centers, churches, offices or other buildings capable of holding a large number of people temporarily.</p><br><p>If there are children in your community, check with local schools to learn their evacuation and shelter plans. In the case of an emergency, parents will want to know where their children will be taken and other steps the schools have prepared for.

This information should be made available to residents in your community through the schools or through a community newsletter or education program.</p><br><p>Some manufactured home communities may have an office or community building that can be used as a shelter in case of an immediate emergency. In the case or tornadoes or severe storms, this should have a below-grade basement or some other underground area.  In other situations, such as floods or hurricanes, the community shelter will not provide maximum protection and designated shelters may e several miles away.</p><br><p>Make sure that your residents understand the difference between an immediate emergency and an evacuation.  For example, when a tornado warning has been issued, they must go to the shelter immediately.  If a hurricane warning is issued, an evacuation is in order.</p><br><p>A good evacuation plan is very important - all residents should be familiar with it and have practiced it.  To develop this plan, work with the residents' committee.  Start with a detailed plan of the community that shows all roads and all homes.  Then look at the following things:</p><br><ul>	<li>How many entrances and exits are there in the community? Are they clearly marked?</li></ul><br><ul>	<li>If there is more than one exit, which sections of the community should use each exit?</li></ul><br><ul>	<li>In what order should each block or section leave?

For each exit, assign blocks or sectors of the community that will use the exit.  Then give each resident a note about the exit they should use and the order in which they will leave.  For example, residents with a Number 1 designation should go first and be given a certain time period in which to do so.  Then Number 2, Number 3 and so on. Orderly evacuation is the goal.</p></div><br><p>Give residents of the community a copy of the evacuation plan for their neighborhood, a map of the community and surrounding areas, a list of potential shelters they can go to, and an alternate exit to use if they can't use the exit they are supposed to use.</p><br><p>They should also be told what kind of notice they will get when evacuation is ordered.

Always maintain its ""curb appeal.""  Regularly check for light outages, broken fencing, faded paint and common-area cleanliness.  Neglected streets are especially annoying to residents.  Of special importance is your entrance.  It should look sharp, upscale</p><p>and inviting.  Invest in flowering plants to add seasonal color.  A well-kept park makes necessary rent adjustments easier to accept.</p><ol>	<li value=""5""><strong>Inadequate training of on-site managers.</strong></li></ol><p>If your park manager is not familiar with mobile home park residency laws, unintentional violations could result.  Staff should be updated on the latest changes.  don't assume they know.  Training for on-site managers is mandatory.  Bring them up-to-date with the latest aspects of insurance, OSHA and health safety issues, worker's compensation laws, Fair Housing and especially Mobilehome Park Landlord/Tenant Laws.</p><ol>	<li value=""6""><strong>Poor marketing.</strong></li></ol><p>Like any business, you have to keep an eye on your local competition while you're keeping your park filled.  But marketing is more than park fill and advertising.  Marketing includes everything from market surveys to community and government relations, from promotions and incentives to get new residents, to good relations with current residents.  Good marketing means keeping a close eye on the target audience you want and how you will sell and service them.</p><p><strong>7.  Mishandling delinquent rents.</strong></p><p>Delinquent rents need quick action.  Monitor them closely.  Mishandling a notice can lead to delays/problems. Listen to a problem to decide if it's permanent/temporary.  If it's permanent, act decisively.  If temporary, you may want to set up a written payment plan if possible.</p><p>8. Getting the wrong insurance package.</p><p>Keeping costs down is important in any business, but so is risk management.  That means insurance.  The key is to look beyond the basic, generic policy and to seek property and general liability insurance with umbrella coverage.  You want to insure your park for its actual insurable replacement value.  Check the rating of the insurance carriers you are considering.  Shop and compare rates/ratings.</p><ol>	<li value=""9""><strong>Inadequate safety &amp; accident prevention programs.</strong></li></ol><p>Insurance is not enough.  Prevention is just as important.  It's all about having a park safe for residents, their visitors and the park staff who serve them.  Potholes in roads are unsafe.  A child's cheerful bike ride could suddenly be ended by an unseen driver because bushes were not trimmed.  Walkways must be well-lighted and free of cracks.  Pools must be free of bacterial growth.  Workers need equipment and training to avoid body movements that can injure them.  Money spent on repairs, signage, equipment, and training is cheap compared to thousands in legal bills, insurance rate increases and time wasted. </p><ol>	<li value=""10""><strong>Insufficient awareness of economic changes.</strong></li></ol><p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Like any business you have to cover costs and make a profit.  In order to maximize your investment, keep abreast of changing local conditions around your park.  An ill-informed decision could make your park unattractive to potential homeowners.  For example, if a local plant closes or unemployment suddenly jumps, that's not a good time to raise rents.  Even in healthy times, periodic small rent adjustments make more sense than one big increase that finds residents unprepared and prone to action.  Subscribe to local newspapers.  It's all about staying in touch and informed to make good decisions.</span></p><p>Note:  This article orignially was published in MHCO's Community Update</p>",839,1506,0,1502,1528,839,1,1415046233,1533923025,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13570,"<div><br><p>A community manager of a 55+ community recently called with a dilemma shared by many other owners.

Within the last month, the husband had had a heart attack, and was no longer able to care for his wife alone.</p><br><p>Throughout this recent period of decline, their only child, a daughter in her late 40's, had been caring for them.  The daughter had retired within the past year, so she was in a perfect position to care for her parents.</p><br><p>Now, the community manager learned that the daughter had moved into the spare bedroom, preparing for her father's return home from the hospital.  Not only had the daughter moved into the spare room, she had sold her home, put her furniture up for auction, and was literally moving into her parents' home with no thought of moving back out.  The mother reportedly had just been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and been given less than six months to live.  The father's prognosis was grim, although he was coming home.  As an only child, the daughter would obviously inherit the home upon their passing.</p><br><p>It appeared to be a situation that would resolve itself within a few years when the daughter reached the minimum secondary age of 50, as stated in the Community Guidelines, however the manager feared losing her exemption status granted under federal law for a 55+ community. And, also contained in the Community Guidelines was a restriction on the length of time a person could have a guest visit them.</p><br><p>Another issue was that their company policy required proof of ownership of the home.  If the legal affairs of the parents were not in order, or if there were another sibling not known to management, this might also present a future problem.</p><br><p>And, with all the health and emotional issues going on, the manager didn'twant to bother the family unnecessarily with details that would just burden them.</p><br><p><strong>What to do?</strong>  First, remember that as a ""caregiver"" there is no age requirement or limitation that applies.  Simply changing the status of the daughter from ""guest"" to ""caregiver"" eliminates part of the problem.  Then, the age limitation also becomes no problem as long as at least one of the parents is still living and the daughter continues as a caregiver, because they are not subject to agent restrictions, either.  And, with at least one of the parents alive, the household still qualifies as one of the required 80% households with at least one person 55 years of age or older.</p><br><p>Then, we are down to ownership of the home, future problems with the legalities of ownership should there be another sibling, and the timing for discussion with the family.  Do not wait to have this discussion.  Yes, the family is extremely busy, but it doesn'tsound as if it will ease up any time soon.  Yes, they probably have their legal affairs in order, but as long as it is handled tactfully, a visit doesn'thave to be an intrusion.</p><br><p>Start the visit by offering your help and asking what you can do.  Then proceed into the legalities of home ownership, etc.  And, remember, you do have the ability to allow 20% of your households to be occupied by a resident under 55 years of age.</p></div><br>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1557155276,1557157562,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13003,"<p align=""center"">A comment made frequently by lenders at a recent national banker's conference was, ""It is a good time to be a borrower."" Correction, <em>it is a <u>great</u> time to be a borrower!</em> Treasury yields have been hovering at or near all time lows, loan spreads are at favorable levels, and lender underwriting guidelines have moderated -- some believe too quickly -- as a result of an expanding supply of active lenders in the market.</p>",959,994,1580,16103,column,und,Finance: Good Times,"<br><p>Most commercial real estate lenders who survived the 2008 market meltdown have worked through their troubled assets, and are once again lending. New lenders, including a multitude of conduit lenders, have joined the fray in anticipation of a large spike in the volume of maturing loans over the next three years. According to a survey released on January 13, 2015, by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), a relative measure of supply and demand showed that lenders were 50% more eager to make loans than borrowers were to take out loans.</p><br><p>Most lenders and participants at the MBA's annual conference, which took place in February 2015, expressed optimism about the overall health of commercial lending markets and future growth prospects. According to the MBA, the amount of commercial and multifamily debt outstanding rose to a record high in the third quarter of 2014, and now stands at $2.6 trillion. New loan originations in 2015 are projected to be $414 billion, an increase of 7% from 2014.</p><br><p>The following is an overview of lending alternatives and the environment we anticipate during the remainder of 2015.</p><br><p><strong>Conduit Lenders</strong></p><br><p>The re-emergence of Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), and conduit lenders who originate these mortgages, has been a key factor in the market's recovery over the past three years. Conduit lenders originate and pool loans that are sold in the capital markets, resulting in attractive financing terms for a wide range of properties and borrowers. While conduit loans are not a good fit for every borrower, they play an essential role underpinning the market by providing lending options for properties that may not otherwise be eligible for competitive financing terms.</p><br><p>Conduit loans have account for as much as 50% of total commercial real estate lending volume in some years. At the peak of the market in 2007, annual U.S. conduit lending volume was close to $230 billion. In 2008, however, the CMBS industry was all but dismantled until the second half of 2012, which marked the comeback of conduit lenders when investors (buyers of CMBS) once again became comfortable with underwriting standards and real estate exposure in general. Conduit loan production in 2014 totaled approximately $101 billion, which was an increase of approximately 19% of 2013, according to a recent issue of <em>Commercial Mortgage Alert</em>. Some insiders are projecting 2015 conduit lending volumes will be as high as $125 billion. CMBS and similar securitized loans currently account for 21% of outstanding commercial and multifamily mortgages in the U.S.</p><br><p>Multifamily properties are highly desired among conduit lenders who need a diverse mix of property types for their loan pools. MHCs in particular are in strong demand among conduit lenders since other lenders, most notable Freddie Mac and Frannie Mae, compete aggressively for traditional apartments thereby making it more difficult for conduit lenders to win that multifamily business.</p><br><p><strong>Government-sponsored entities</strong></p><br><p>Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac are the two government-sponsored entities (GSEs) that actively lend on MHCs. They have the directive from their regulator to enhance the flow of credit to multifamily properties nationwide. Fannie Mae was the most reliable lender, and often the only option, during the most recent lending crisis. On April 29 2014, Freddie Mac received approval from its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to begin lending on MHCs. This move is reflective of a more expansive role for the GSE's being signaled by FHFA director Mel Watt, who assumed office on January 6, 2014.</p><br><p>FNMA loans are accessed through Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) lenders who are designated to underwrite, process, close, and service loans for Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac loans are accessed through its designated lenders, called sellers/servicers, who play the same role as Fannie Mae's DUS lenders.</p><br><p>GSE's offer very attractive terms, including recently introduced early rate lock options, and GSE loans now comprise 43% of outstanding multifamily mortgage debt in the United States. In 2014, FNMA and Freddie Mac provided $1.5 billion in financing to MHC owners, and we expect this to be substantially higher in 2015 since Freddie Mac was not lending on MHCs until the second half of 2014. In addition, MHC loans are excluded from GSE annual lending volume caps, which should further increase the GSE's demand for MHC loans.</p><br><p><strong>Life Insurance Companies</strong></p><br><p>Life insurance companies (Lifecos) have an ongoing need to invest money in long-term, fixed rate investments with defined maturities, which includes commercial real estate loans. Lifecos purchase CMBS as investors, and also directly originate loans to borrowers. In 2014, lifecos originated $61 billion of commercial real estate loans, and account for 14% of outstanding U.S. commercial and multifamily debt.</p><br><p>With regard to MHCs, Lifecos continue to focus on higher quality, preferably age-restricted, communities in larger markets with financially strong and experienced borrowers. They generally pursue larger loan sizes ($5 million or more) at lower leverage levels than can usually be achieved with conduit or GSE lenders. Lifecos tend to have a pricing advantage for loans with fixed rate terms in excess of 10 years, and they also offer the ability for the borrower to lock rates at the time of application.</p><br><p><strong>Banks and Thrifts</strong></p><br><p>Bank and thrifts hold the largest share, 37%, of outstanding commercial and multifamily mortgages in the U.S. assisted by the tailwinds of improving property values, bank and thrifts have addressed most of their ""bad"" real estate loans, and are now expanding loan origination efforts. Additionally, bank deposits have increased, providing additional funds to lend. Banks and thrifts originated $944 billion in new commercial and multifamily loans in 2014.</p><br><p>Bank lending in usually limited geographically to the footprint of the bank's retail network as many banks prefer to lend only to local borrowers to whom they can also provide additional banking services. Furthermore, since banks typically require a personal guarantee, their underwriting focuses more intensely on the individual providing the personal guarantee.</p><br><p>Some banks consider MHCs to be a special purpose property type outside the scope of their normal lending activity, and therefore, approach MHC lending in a conservative manner. However, there are substantial differences across the country in bank lending programs that are offered for MHCs. In some regions, such as the west coast, there are banks that market specifically to the MHC sector.</p><br><p>In summary, financing is readily available for solid quality MHCs in most markets. Lenders will continue to compete heavily for the higher quality properties and borrowers. While disruptions in the capital markets could put the brakes on the good times, it is great to be finally talking about commercial lending without analyzing the state of the market recovery.</p><br><p align=""center"">Tony Petosa and Nick Bertino of Wells Fargo Multifamily Capital specialize in providing financing for MHCs through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, conduit, and balance sheet lending programs.

These R&amp;Rs can include items like maintaining yards, limiting on-street parking, allowing or prohibiting fences, cleaning up after pets, deck sizes, night time quite hours and a whole host of other items governing how your community is maintained and used. </p>",959,994,1580,16126,column,und,First Commercial Property Article: The Importance of Rules and Regulations in YOUR Community,"<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">WHY SHOULD YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT R&amp;Rs:  ASSET VALUE - Firstly, a SIGNIFICANT part of your community's real estate value is based on how well Residents adhere to the R&amp;Rs which YOU as an Owner/Manager must enforce!   CASH FLOW -  Second, because rule violations, with the exception of non-payment of rent issues, are the number one reason Residents get evicted, we cannot emphasize enough, how important it is to keep your rules up to date, so that you prevail when spending money in the legal process... .got your attention????  Read on: </span></p><p>ORS 90.510 <strong>requires</strong> that the Rules and Regulations and a copy of your rental agreement be handed out as attachments to the Statement of Policy (SOP) to prospective and existing Tenants.  When giving these documents to prospective Tenants, you should have them sign a receipt for Statement of Policy.  All too often we have heard Tenants state in court that they never signed or received a copy of the Rules and are therefore not bound by them.   By producing a copy of the signed receipt for Statement of Policy, the presumption is that they did receive the rules even if they never read them.</p><p>As mentioned above, it's extremely important to keep your rules updated.  In MHCs that we've managed, we have discovered rules that are 2 pages and we've seen some that are 30 pages... .some Community Owners have not revised this IMPORTANT governing document since the 1970s!  Many of these older and/or shorter sets of rules do not even mention many of the issues relevant today.  So if you want to change or update your rules, know that there are two methods to accomplish this.</p><p>First is a general rule change that affects all of the Residents:  ORS 90.610 sets out the requirements for the notice of proposed change in Rule or Regulations.  The statutory time-line for the Residents to OBJECT to the change(s) is 30 days after receiving the written change(s.)  If 51% of the eligible spaces object in writing to the proposed change, the new rule(s) <strong>do not</strong> go into effect.  If less than 51% object in writing within the 30 day window, the new rule(s) go into effect for all Residents 60 days after the notice was mailed. </p><p>The second method to changing rules is through attrition.  There is nothing in the statute that prevents an Owner/Manager from creating a second and more comprehensive set of rules and handing them out with the SOP to new prospective Residents.  The new rules will only be enforceable on the new Residents; since all homes change ownership eventually, once you have enough new Residents on the new rules, you can always go for a general rule change effecting everyone.  Many or most Residents would already be subject to the new rules, the mathematical probability of having 51% object to the rule is greatly diminished.   Remember to keep a copy of whatever generation of R&amp;Rs the Resident agreed to in their resident file.  You do not want to try to enforce a new rule on an old Resident who is subject to a previous version of the rules.</p><p>Our next article will deal with R&amp;R enforcement, so stay tuned!</p>",23,1504,0,1502,1528,23,1,1436969789,1438881472,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12925,"<p>If you are reading this, chances are you are one of the millions of baby boomers at or near retirement. Although you might not care for the moniker, the government has officially designated you as an ""older person"". If you own property designated as housing for ""seniors"" you should periodically refresh yourself on the state of the law protecting ""older persons"" and to avoid the mistakes of other property owners.</p>",959,994,1580,16025,column,und,Form 1099 and Protecting Your Investment,"<p>History</p><p>The Civil Rights Act of 1968 enacted The Fair Housing Act (""FHA"") to prohibit housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The FHA was amended in 1988 to expand its coverage to prohibit discrimination based on disability or family status, meaning the presence of a child under the age of 18 and pregnant women. Because the creation of families as a protected class clashed with the operation of retirement or adult communities, the 1988 amendments included exemptions for housing developments that qualified as housing for persons over the age of 55. Because there was an inherent conflict between protected family status and the exemption for older persons, Congress responded with The Housing For Older Persons Act of 1995 (""HOPA"") which fine tuned the exemptions and is now the definitive authority for owners of such housing. (You should also be aware that municipalities can have ordinances prohibiting discrimination for categories broader than the Civil Rights Act. Examples of common ordinances gaining popularity are discrimination in housing on the basis of HIV/AIDS status, sexual orientation. Such ordinances are not addressed in this article.)</p><p>Occupancy Requirement to Qualify for Exemption</p><p>HOPA maintained the requirement that at least 80% of exempt housing must have one occupant who is 55 years of age or older. It also still required that the exempt hosing publish and follow policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be housing for persons 55 and older. Significant in terms of capital costs, HOPA eliminated the requirement that 55 and older hosing had to maintain ""significant facilities and services"" designed for the elderly. (Communities that are occupied solely by persons who are 62 and older are also exempt from the prohibition against family discrimination under Section 100.303.)</p><p>""Wiggle Room"" Factor</p><p>At first blush, the 80% requirement appears to give a property owner some ""wiggle room"" to comply with the exemption. HOPA specifically allows a 55 and older community to be ""exempt"" from the preference for families if, after September 13, 1988, 80% of the units are occupied by at least one person age 55 years or older. Units occupied by employees of the housing facility or community who are under the age 55 do not count against the 80% as long as the employees perform substantial duties related to the management or maintenance of the community. Likewise, units occupied by persons who are disabled and require a reasonable accommodation, also do not count against the 80%.</p><p>However, the 80% requirement can also be a property owners' pitfall if it is achieved improperly. The 80% requirement does not mean that the property owner can manipulate the remaining 20% of units occupied by persons under the age of 55. The 80% occupancy requirement is coupled with an additional requirement that the facility or community adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent to be a 55 or older facility. A manager cannot merely choose to rent to ""good"" non-seniors or families just because the facility is over 80% senior.</p><p>One provision of HOPA which, on the surface, appears troublesome is Section 100.305(h) which provides that each housing facility may determine the age restriction for units that are not occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. On its face, this provision appears to allow a community to set any age requirement it wishes for the twenty percent (20%) of spaces which are not required to be occupied by a person 55 years of age or older, including requiring the occupants of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of spaces to be adults. However, this would appear to be contrary to the general intent of the FHA to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ""family status"". A more likely interpretation is that the housing provider need not apply any age restriction on occupancy of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of rental units. This interpretation seems likely, not only in view of the general intent of the FHA, but in view of Section 100.306(d) which provides that a housing facility or community may allow occupancy by families with children as long as it meets the intent requirements of Sections 100.305 and 100.306(a).</p><p>An argument could well be made that a community must allow up to twenty percent (20%) of the spaces to be occupied by persons who do not otherwise satisfy the community's minimum age requirements. The problem is that a park which ""uses up"" its twenty percent (20%) allotment may find itself below the 80% requirement if a space which was previously occupied by a person 55 years of age or older ceases to be so occupied. This could occur as a result of an older tenant dying or moving out of the community.</p><p>It has been our experience that HUD has, from time to time, interpreted the ""twenty percent"" allowance as a ""fudge factor"" in order to avoid hardship where, for example, an older tenant dies, leaving a widow who does not satisfy the community's minimum age requirements. This interpretation was bolstered by the requirement that the housing be intended for persons 55 years of age or older and that the properties have rules that limit residency to persons meeting the age requirements. Deliberately allowing persons under the age of 55 to move into the community seems contrary to this intention.</p><p>**Tip: In many states the law requires that mobile home parks owners uniformly enforce all published rules. To allow some households to avoid the requirement could run afoul of such laws leaving the door open for a disgruntled tenant to sue on a claim that the management is not uniformly enforcing its own rules.</p><p>Published Procedures &amp; Policies of Intent</p><p>In addition to requiring that at least 80% of the occupied units be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older, HOPA requires that the housing be ""intended and operated"" for person 55 years of age or older, and that the housing facility ""publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate its intent"" to qualify for the 55 or older exemption. Section 100.306(a) sets forth a non-exclusive list or relevant factors in determining whether the park ""demonstrates"" this ""intent"":</p><p>(1) The manner in which the housing facility is described to prospective residents;<br />(2) And advertising designed to attract prospective residents;<br />(3) Lease provisions;<br />(4) Written rules and regulations;<br />(5) The maintenance and consistent application or relevant procedures;<br />(6) Actual practices; and<br />(7) Public posting in common areas of statements describing the facility as housing for persons 55 years of age or older;</p><p>These requirements bolster the ""common sense"" approach to a community demonstrating its intent to be housing for older persons. Specifically, without limitation, the parks' residency documents need to clearly state the age restrictions on residency, and the age restrictions need to be consistently enforced.</p><p>Unscrupulous attempts by property owners to manipulate the intent to remain senior housing have resulted in adverse judgments. In a 2003 federal case in California, Housing Rights Center et al. v. Galaxy Apartments, et al., the apartment complex and management company was sued for allegedly telling an expectant mother that it would not accept families with children because it was a ""seniors only"" complex. The Housing Rights Center sent ""testers"" to the building and learned that childless adult testers of all ages were accepted and only testers with children or who were expecting children were told that the complex was seniors only. Obviously, the apartment owner was not complying with the ""intent"" of the over 55 exemption and was ordered to pay the plaintiffs $51,000 and enter into a two year fair housing training program.</p><p>Some states require that housing intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older register with state agencies. You should consult your legal counsel for the applicable registration and renewal process in your state.</p><p>Age Verification</p><p>HOPA provides specific guidelines for ""age verification"". To protect your property, these procedures should be followed to the point that, at any given time in the past, you should be able to demonstrate, the percentage of units that were occupied by at least one person age 55 or older.</p><p>Section 100.307(d) provides that the following documents are considered ""reliable"" documentation of the age of the occupants:</p><p>(1) Driver's license;<br />(2) Birth Certificate;<br />(3) Passport;<br />(4) Immigration card;<br />(5) Military identification;<br />(6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability, or<br />(7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.</p><p>This last provision is useful in those cases where tenants who are believed to be over 55 years of age fail or refuse to provide proof of age to the park by allowing any other adult member of the household to sign a statement to the effect that the person in question is, in fact, at least 55 years of age.</p><p>**Tip: Make it a policy to obtain a written application for tenancy from every household and keep those applications for the length of the tenancy.</p><p>Section 100.307(g) further provides that: ""If the occupants of a particular dwelling unit fail to comply with the age verification procedures, the housing facility or community may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older."" This section goes on to provide that such evidence may include government records or documents, such as a census; prior forms or applications; or a statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants. In the latter case, the individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge. Compliance with this provision most probably would be met by a park employee statement as to their opinion of the age of a tenant, based upon the tenant's appearance and, if applicable, the apparent age of the tenant's adult children.</p><p>A typical pitfall for owners of such properties is the HOPA requirement that the age verification information must be updated at least every two years, pursuant to Section 100.307(c).</p><p>**Tip: In addition to keeping the tenant's application, the management should consider developing a form which it distributes to all spaces at least once every two years, asking residents to confirm the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home. This is probably good policy in any case, since a record of what adults are actually occupying a home is useful in other situations (e.g., naming all adults occupants in an unlawful detainer complaint.)</p><p>MHCO has a number of forms specifically designed for use in a ""55 and Older Community"".

And that is only for starters.</span></p></div><div><br><br></div>",959,994,1580,16321,column,und,Handling Violations to Rules and Regulations,"<div><p>But when all is said and done, the one thing that takes most of the community manager's time is handling guideline violations.  How do you, as an extremely busy person, do this with only a minimum amount of time invested?  How do you handle residents as a fragile yet necessary part of your business and still get everything else done without making them feel that they are an imposition to you?  How do you notify and discuss a guidelines violation with a resident without starting World War III?  And, most importantly, how do you facilitate correction of outstanding violations in a timely manner.</p><br><h2 align=""center"">Steps Toward Resolution</h2><br><br><p><strong>As with anything, there are no easy answers</strong> to these questions.  Resolving problems must start before there is a problem.  That means starting with the administrative side of your community.  For a first step, look at the document you use for your community guidelines.  Is it clearly written?  Are the guidelines reasonable?  Are they enforceable? </p><br><p>The second step is the orientation process.  It is imperative that as a community manager, you take time to discuss certain items with residents after they have been approved.  The lease, the terms of the rental agreement, and the specific requirements and provisions contained in the guidelines are high on the list of items to discuss.  Is this a time-consuming process?  Most definitely.  And is there an alternative?  None that are really acceptable.  New residents will probably sign a statement that says they received the guidelines, have read them and agree to abide by them, even if they haven'tread them.</p><br><p><strong>This is the start of a major problem</strong> for you as a community manager.  They will most likely not go home and read the guidelines and, therefore, won't call you with any questions, because they can't possibly have any.  This is the beginning of a major problem for you as a community manager.  Your first realization that there is a problem should be when you see them in violation of one or more of the guidelines.  When they receive a notice, a phone call, or a visit from you, one of their first comments is almost sure to be, ""No one told me I couldn'tdo that,"" followed by an incredulous look of disbelief.</p><br><p><strong>As a community manager,</strong> you are now in the position of not only enforcing your guidelines, but defending and explaining them as well.  This is not an enviable position, </p></div><br><div><p>because rarely do such interactions end quickly or peacefully. Residents feel insulted, defensive and that they must somehow come out on top in a contest of wills.  A community manager that comes on too strongly, that threatens eviction over the littlest thing, or that appears to be unreasonable will not gain cooperation from this resident, now or ever.</p><br><br><h2 align=""center"">The Nightmare Begins</h2><br><br><p><strong>Now you've begun  a nightmare of a resident relations problem,</strong> and it's sure to affect resident retention.  The simple act of discussing guidelines during the orientation process can usually eliminate most of this grief.  Hand-in-hand with the discussion, the resident needs to acknowledge his responsibilities and agree to abide by the terms explained in the guidelines.</p><br><p>The acknowledgement was for years obtained in the form of a separate statement that the new resident signed.</p><br><p>This statement went something like: ""The undersigned agrees that he has read and understands all requirements as presented in the guidelines, and agrees to adhere to the terms contained therein during the time he is a resident of this community.""</p><p>A copy of the guidelines was then given to the resident for future reference.  In reality, community managers usually cut corners in the presentation and discussion of the lease and the guidelines.  The resident usually makes it eminently clear that he is trying to move, is in a hurry, and doesn'thave time for a lot of paperwork.  What a shame for everyone.  This is a resident who is headed for misunderstandings and a community manager who is headed for problems.</p><br><p>When discussing guidelines with a new resident, take time to talk about each and every term and provision.  Then, request that the resident, and all adult members of the family, either initial or sign each page of the guidelines.</p><br><br><h2 align=""center"">Laid Out in Black &amp; White</h2><br><br><p><strong>When a resident violates one of the guidelines</strong> and you have those initialed pages, you have the ability to turn a potentially contentious situation into a routine notification process.  It happens because you now are able to simply send a basic form letter that saying  ""It appears that you may have decided to alter your lifestyle in such a way that it no longer is aligned with the guidelines for this community.  At the time you joined us as a resident, we discussed the guidelines that set acceptable parameters of behavior and responsibility for resident and management alike who live in (community name).  Please call the office so that we may discuss  your decision to change your lifestyle with you.""  Then, staple a copy of the initialed page with the violated guideline(s) currently being violated.</p><br><p>What happens is the realization on the part of the resident that he is caught dead to rights.  There is no wiggle room here.  There is no need for him to try to defend his actions or to tell you that he didn'tknow he was violating a guideline.  And, there is no need for him to feel like he is backed into a corner and has to become aggressive or belligerent.  Your notice simply acknowledges that he has made a choice, and asks for him to take time to discuss it with you.</p><br><p>Remember, the best resident relations program can be compared to a round room:  If you don't back a resident into a corner where he has to defend himself you can truly have a productive conversation, mutual respect, and a meeting of the minds.  If you force him to lose face; if you turn this type of situation into a confrontation where the battle lines are drawn; or if you place a large amount of importance on the ""winning"" of every disagreement, you've lost the resident relations game before you even started.</p><br><p>Resolve those guideline violations that frequently happen by using peer pressure, rewards, public recognition, and, once in a while, fear.  By using all</p></div><p>these techniques and more, you can truly enforce your guidelines and build your resident relations program to new heights.</p><br><p>Yours will be the community run by a manager with a reputation for being fair, honest, and consistent.  The time and emotional energy you spend on guideline violations will be greatly reduced, and the time you do spend in the future will be much more pleasant.</p><br><br><h2 align=""center"">Where The Problems Lie</h2><br><p><strong>Which of your community guide-lines are violated the most often?   </strong>What problems do you need to eliminate in order to better meet the goals of your community owner or to have a more professionally operated community?</p><br><p>Among these are reducing receivables; out-of-compliance clotheslines; the building of decks that are required as part of the initial installation but are still not done 60 days later; installation of skirting that is supposed to be done by a third party and remains undone; residents who ride bicycles on the community streets without paying attention to motorists; and residents who ""forget"" the streets have a speed limit and are not part of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1475006370,1475006874,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12920,"<p>There are many considerations taken into account by Insurance companies when looking into insuring a Mobile Home Park.</p>",959,994,1580,16020,column,und,Helpful Tips for 55 & Older Community Owners,"<p>The following are just some of the factors:</p><p>- Type of Park:<br />Are you family friendly, 55 &amp; older, Seasonal, or possibly a combination?</p><p>- Management:<br />Is your park managed by a management company?

Two graduate social work students serving as interns in the Multnomah County Office of Aging and Disability Services convened various agencies to meet for a ""community assessment."" Attendees have included representatives of several nonprofit and for-profit housing providers, Aging and Disability and Adult Protective Services, Legal Aid, Animal Control, and Assessments and Tax. This Hoarding Task Force has continued to meet regularly, researching resources and bringing in experts to assist in coordinating services and developing best practices.

This might include providing an agreed upon length of time to bring in a professional cleaner / organizer to help clear pathways, reduce pile heights, clear materials in front of heating vents, etc. More will probably be needed than a single deep clean. There may be several steps to the RA request, prioritizing the most immediate safety needs and then allowing a more gradual timeline for reducing other clutter, in conjunction with a professional organizer or mental health provider.</p><br><p>As with any RA request, housing providers need to evaluate the request and the verification of disability and respond in a timely manner. Housing providers are always well advised to review the legal reasons for denial, consult with a fair housing attorney, document the rationale for their decision, and feel comfortable defending it if a complaint / case follows when making a decision on a RA request.  As always, regardless of the request that's made or what the disability is, if a denial is made, HUD says a conversation should ensue about what would work for the individual with the disability. </p><br><p>Want to learn more?

To add to the confusion, employers must comply with both sets of rules for covered employees.  For ""non-exempt"" employees, this means paying employees at least the applicable minimum wage (currently $7.25 under the FLSA and between $10.00 and $11.25 under Oregon law, depending on location).  Employers are also responsible for paying overtime to non-exempt employees for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a week at no less than one and one half times the employee's regular rate.</p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, Oregon law provides a minimum wage and overtime exemption for resident mobile home park employees engaged in management and maintenance.  ORS 653.020(18).  As a consequence, mobile home park managers, assistant managers, and maintenance employees residing on the employer's premises generally are exempt from the Oregon minimum wage and overtime requirements.  The troublesome issue for Oregon employers is that the FLSA does not provide a similar exemption.  The impact is that unless an employee qualifies as a salaried, exempt ""white collar"" employee under the FLSA, the employee will be entitled to the federal minimum wage and overtime.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Housing under the FLSA</strong></p><p> </p><p>Assuming an employee is non-exempt under the FLSA, is it legal for an employer to credit employer-paid housing toward satisfying an employee's minimum wage? In other words, may an employee pay less than $7.25 an hour in cash, if it also provides free housing to the employee?  The answer is a qualified ""yes.""  Under the FLSA, an employer may count as wages the <strong>reasonable cost </strong>to the employer of furnishing an employee with board, lodging, and other facilities under qualifying circumstances.  However, there are strict requirements for counting the housing costs toward the FLSA minimum wage.</p><p> </p><p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), in order to take credit for housing as ""wages,"" an employer must satisfy all of the following factors: (1) the lodging is regularly provided by the employer or similar employers; (2) the employee <strong>voluntarily</strong> <strong>accepts</strong> the lodging; (3) the lodging is furnished in compliance with applicable law; (4) the lodging is provided primarily <strong>for the benefit of the employee</strong> rather than the employer; and (5) the employer maintains accurate records of the costs incurred in furnishing the lodging. An employer counting on housing to substitute for part or all of an employee's federal minimum wage will have the burden of establishing all of these factors, if challenged.  Satisfying the tests, particularly where an employer requires the employee to live on the employer's premises is a challenging proposition.</p><p> </p><p>If an employer does satisfy the DOL test, the employer may be able to count the cost of the housing toward the federal minimum wage requirement. Thus, if the employer provides housing that reasonably costs it $300 per week, and the employee works 40 hours a week, the employer has satisfied the federal minimum wage without the payment of additional cash wages:  $300 is greater than $290 (40 x $7.25 = $290) Note that ""cost"" of the housing is not the same as ""fair market value,"" and may not include any amount of employer profit.  Thus, if an employer provides an employee with a mobile home that typically rents for $1000 per month, the possible cost that the employer may count toward the minimum wage would be less than $1000 per month. </p><p> </p><p>Employers taking credit for housing costs and paying less than the federal minimum wage in cash wages must keep accurate and detailed records establishing the employer cost of the housing provided to employees.  Failure to do so will result in the denial of the offset and potential liability for any unpaid minimum wages, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is it Worth the Effort? </strong></p><p> </p><p>As discussed above, qualifying for and establishing a minimum wage offset for housing is a rigorous ordeal.  Fortunately, there is a risk-free alternative: assuming the employee is a resident manager, assistant manager, or maintenance employee exempt under Oregon minimum wage requirements, simply pay the employee at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked.  That eliminates the federal minimum wage issue, the recordkeeping requirements, and the risks of an expensive DOL audit or lawsuit. </p><div class=""main-body-wrap""><div class=""view_staff_member"" id=""view_staff_member""><div class=""left-column""><div class=""staff-tab-content ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all"" id=""tabs""><div aria-hidden=""false"" aria-labelledby=""ui-id-1"" class=""ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom"" id=""tabs-1"" role=""tabpanel""><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>Kent Pearson</strong></span> has practiced labor and employment law for over 30 years.

The judge looked to the park rules, which were drafted by a tenants' committee before discrimination based on familial status was prohibited, that expressly stated the park was ""entirely an adult park"" and ""no children will be allowed in the park."" Even after the landlord agreed to retract this policy and the mobilehome was sold to a couple with children, after being notified by the buyer's attorney the ""adult only"" policy was illegal, the administrative law judge found the landlord liable for discrimination under FHA, and the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed.</p><p>This analytical approach used by courts and regulators of scrutinizing a manufactured home community's rules for evidence of discrimination against families with children has continued to evolve and is even more prominent today as demonstrated by a recent federal case arising out of California.</p>",959,994,1580,16058,column,und,How Age-Restrictive Rules Can Violate the Fair Housing Act: Lessons From the Plaza Mobile Estates Case,"<p>How Age-Restrictive Rules Can Violate the Fair Housing Act: Lessons From the Plaza Mobile Estates Case</p><p><strong>The Plaza Mobile Estates Case</strong></p><p>United States of America v. Plaza Mobile Estates, et al., 273 F. Supp. 2d 1084 (C.D Cal. 2003) is a federal district court decision which is a cause for concern to all landlords, particularly owners of manufactured home communities. The United States and residents of several mobilehome parks sued the owners and managers, seeking a declaration that various park rules violated the FHA based on familial status, and sought injunctive relief to preclude any further publication or enforcement of the discriminatory rules. The court found that the rules at issue were discriminatory on their face because they treated children, and thus families with children, differently and less favorably than adults-only households.</p><p>The decision was reached by the district court, not the Court of Appeals, and therefore is not binding precedent on federal appellate courts, or state courts. However, it is a published decision which can be cited as authority in federal district court litigation, particularly within the central district of California.</p><p><strong>Rules Found Discriminatory </strong></p><p>The court invalidated the ""preambles"" to the rules of several of the defendant mobilehome parks which stated that the park was ""designed and built as an adult facility"" or ""designed as an ADULT facility."" [Emphasis added]. The court found that these preambles were clear examples of illegal ""steering."" The court recognized that while the preambles were not outright refusals to sell or rent to families with children, they clearly suggested a preference for adults only and discouraged families with children from applying for residency.</p><p>The specific age restrictive rules invalidated by the court fell into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions; (2) adult supervision requirements; and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><p>The absolute prohibitions included those rules that: (1) prohibited all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles; (2) prohibited all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool; (3) prohibited all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or jacuzzi; (4) required all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence; and (5) prohibited all children from playing on park streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court found that while the health and safety of the children and other residents of the park were legitimate concerns, these absolute prohibitions were not the least restrictive means to achieve such ends. It noted that any concerns that the community owners may have had were not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior could be addressed with the use of non-age related rules. The court held that requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban was clearly a less restrictive means of achieving the park's legitimate goals. However, the court also invalidated a number of adult supervision requirements.</p><p>Adult supervision requirements invalidated by the court included those rules that required adult supervision for: (1) children under 18 years old using recreational facilities (recreation building and/or clubhouse), swimming pool, sun deck, saunas and laundry room; (2) children under 14 years old using recreational facilities, swimming pool and tennis courts, and riding bicycles; (3) children under 10 years old using recreational facilities; and (4) all children walking around the park.</p><p>As with the absolute prohibitions, these adult supervision requirements were likewise found not the least restrictive means to achieve any health and safety objectives. The court commented that the park's concerns could be addressed by the use of rules, and that bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.</p><p>The hours of access restrictions included those rules that prohibited use of the swimming pool and sundeck to children under 18 years old except during specified hours. The court summarily rejected defendants' attempt to justify these swimming pool hours restrictions as ""equitably accounting for the interest of tenants,"" noting that this clearly was not a compelling interest. The court further noted that the interest or desire of the adult tenants to discriminate against children could never justify such discrimination.</p><p><strong>Compelling Business Necessity Standard</strong></p><p>Having found that the age-restrictive rules were discriminatory on their face, the court held that the burden passed to the community owners to justify the rules. The standard applied by the court was whether the owners had a legitimate justification for the discrimination rising to the level of a compelling business necessity as to which the least restrictive means to achieve such end was used. Both criteria, compelling business necessity and least restrictive means, must be satisfied to defeat the claim of unlawful discrimination. The court in Plaza Mobile Estates found that the owners had failed to make this showing.</p><p><strong>HUD Approval: No Defense</strong></p><p>What is particularly distressing about the Plaza Mobile Estates opinion is that the court invalidated rules which had been approved as part of a Conciliation Agreement entered into with the intervention and approval of HUD. The owners contended that HUD's approval of the Conciliation Agreement required the conclusion that the rules approved thereunder did not violate the FHA. The court noted that it is the court, not HUD, that is the final arbiter in determining whether the rules are in compliance with the FHA. It therefore appears that a community owner cannot even rely upon the opinion of HUD or the state enforcement agency as a defense against a claim of discrimination.</p><p><strong>How Community Owners Can Protect Themselves</strong></p><p>In view of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, landlords need to carefully review their rules and regulations and revise them to eliminate rules which appear to discriminate against families with children. Particularly suspect are rules which expressly refer to children, or persons under age 18. Other rules, which may not contain an express age restriction, are still subject to attack if they have a disparate impact on persons under age 18 or tend to ""steer"" toward an ""adult only"" preference.</p><p>For instance, community advertising and residency documents obviously must not contain discriminatory phrases and language, such as ""adults only,"" ""retirement community,"" or ""community for active adults."" In ""all-age"" communities, there should not be any ""adults only"" restrictions on the use of common areas, recreational facilities or equipment (except where authorized by state law or regulations). Access to the community's facilities should not be prohibited to children, and unreasonable supervision requirements must be avoided.</p><p>Also, review signs posted throughout the community (whether in the clubhouse or the laundry room, by the swimming pool, or along the streets) for discriminatory words or phrases.</p><p>For approval of new tenants, have written policies and guidelines and follow them consistently. Always offer an application to a potential resident, and keep those applications you reject (as well as those you accept).</p><p>In speaking to prospective residents, avoid words which might discourage a family with children; avoid ""steering"" someone to another community or to limited areas within your own community; do not ask about the ethnic, religious or national background of any applicant; do not discuss the problems which a disabled person may encounter in a manufactured home or in your community. Certain words should be avoided, such as: compatible (as in, ""Your type is not compatible with our community""), prefer (as in, ""We prefer married couples""), discourage (as in, ""We discourage children because we have so many elderly residents""), or suitable (such as, ""A mobilehome park is not suitable for small children"").</p><p>Even if you have adopted good policies and procedures and have trained your management team to be aware of fair housing principles, there is the chance that the policies are not followed. Make sure your staff does follow through!</p><p>The following are some additional suggestions:</p><p><em>--Always take an application from any interested person.</em>‰Û¬‰Û¬<em>--Deal the same with all prospective residents: be pleasant, courteous and non-judgmental. Answer all questions.</em>‰Û¬‰Û¬<em>--Keep a record of each inquiry and try to obtain as much information as possible about each person. Also, keep all tenancy and application records for at least two years.</em></p><p>What age-restrictive rules are still permissible? At least in California, it is probably still permissible to require children under the age of 14 to be supervised by an adult (but not specifically a parent) when using the swimming pool or spa pool. This is based upon section 65539 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations (""CCR""), which provides that, where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view which shall state, ""Children Under the Age 14 Should Not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance."" Interestingly, even this code section only says ""should,"" not ""shall."" Local counsel should be consulted regarding similar provisions in other states.</p><p>For years in California, the CCR language has been used by analogy to require adult supervision for the use of other recreational facilities. It is no longer safe to do this. The community may still be able to require adult supervision where needed to minimize risk of injury or death in situations in addition to the swimming pool and spa pool situation referenced in the CCR. Again, the adult supervision cannot be restricted to a parent; any responsible adult can perform the required supervision.</p><p>A park may be able to prohibit an activity which is more likely to be engaged in by children than by adults if there is an express ordinance in the municipality where the park is located prohibiting this activity. A primary example of this would be a municipal ordinance prohibiting skateboarding.</p><p>It must always be kept utmost in mine that the basic test is that any age-restrictive rule or regulation must satisfy both criteria stated by the Plaza Mobile Estates court: There must be a compelling business necessity for the policy, and the rule must be the least restrictive means to achieve that policy. This is a standard which is difficult to satisfy. Community owners should consult with legal counsel in reviewing and revising their rules to minimize the risk of liability under state and federal laws prohibiting discrimination against families with children.</p><p><em>Robert G.

A dream come true for a lot of senior citizens.  Filling vacant spaces can be the most important improvement made to any Mobile Home Park and because there is a growing trend for people, especially seniors, to live in RV's full time, park owners are filling spaces with ""Permanent RV"" tenants.  This certainly will fill spaces quickly and with minimal cost to the park.  Additionally, living in an RV is one of the most affordable ways to live and many of the RV's are larger than a studio apartment.   Apparently, the new trend in apartment building is studio apartments with as little as 200 square feet!  Therefore, filling spaces with ""Permanent RV's"" seems to be a win-win situation, but there are some long term fallbacks that should be considered.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16122,column,und,Kim Berry: Filling Mobile Spaces with RV's : The Pros and Cons,"<p>When you drive through a ""pure mobile home park"" and then drive through a park with a lot of RV tenants you can feel the difference in overall quality.  The overall value of a MHP with ""Permanent RV"" tenants mixed in with Mobile Home tenants is lower than a MHP which is completely filled with Mobile Homes.  RV's are not really permanent homes so MHP buyers and banks see RV occupancy as more risky than Mobile Home occupancy.  The appraised value is lower, the interest rate that the bank charges can be higher and the pool of interested buyers is smaller.  There are a number of MHPs in Oregon which have RV tenants who have been tenants in the same space for over 15 years, but even if you prove this to a bank, they can still be hesitant to lend on the park.  Many buyers will simply not look at MHPs with a high percentage of RV tenants.  One advantage of having RV tenants to fill spaces is that you can give them a 60 day no cause notice to move out.  This can be beneficial for two reasons.  Firstly, if the tenant turns out to be a problem tenant who does not adhere to the rules, it is easy to replace them with a good tenant.  This also allows a MHP owner to temporarily fill spaces with RV tenants but replace them with Mobile Homes when they find one to put into that space.  Of course, it is always a good idea to inform an RV tenant that this is your intention before they move in and expect to live there for years.</p><p>Not only does the park income rise when spaces are full, but the overall feeling of full occupancy is good for tenants, management and once full, parks with 100% full lots tend to stay that way for a very long time.  Vacant spaces can make a Mobile Home Park feel old, neglected, and undesirable even if it is well maintained otherwise.  Also, we all know that it is expensive to bring even a used Mobile Home into a park. The purchase of the house, moving expenses, set up, and final touch up will generally run at least $17,000 for a single wide and anywhere from $35,000 - $60,000+ for a double wide home.   Other items to consider are the sales commissions for the Mobile Home Dealer and it can prove to be difficult to get both a house, and a tenant to both qualify for bank financing.  Having the park buy and set up mobile homes can be a risk but may be worth it.  There is really no calculation or standard that determines what the reduction in value of a MHP with RV tenants is but it certainly is the case that the demand is lower and lending is more difficult.</p><p>By using a good Mobile Home Dealer who can find used mobile homes to fill spaces, arrange them to be moved and set up and then sell them is a win-win situation.  There are a number of highly reputable licensed dealers who can seamlessly fill vacant spaces and in the end the cost is usually worth it when you calculate the improvement made to the park.  If you are thinking about selling your MHP, and even if you are not expecting to, it makes sense to improve your property for long term value.</p><p>On the other hand, simply having RV tenants pull their RV into a space has many short term benefits for both the tenant and the MHP.  The screening criteria is still the same so the RV tenants make up a very good pool of possible tenants.  All in all a pure MHP is more desirable but RV tenants can be as long term as Mobile Home tenants and  with the trend heading in the direction of very small living spaces, RV living may be considered a luxury before long.    </p><p>Kim Berry, Principal Broker</p><p>Rundle CRE - Mobile Home Brokers</p><p>5319 SW Westgate Dr. Suite 232</p><p>Portland, OR  97221</p><p>503-980-3512</p><p>CELL:  503-807-2568</p><p>FAX:    360-935-3512</p><br><br>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1435764336,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12909,"<p align=""center""><strong style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Question:  </strong><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">We have RV spaces at the front of our  mobile home park on a well-traveled highway near the coast.  We have been renting only to long-term RV'ers, but want to expand our business opportunities to include overnighters.  Is that permissible and how do we do that?</span></p><br>",959,994,1580,16009,column,und,"Lessons From a $76,000 Fair Housing Settlement","<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is permissible to rent to overnighters, but there are some important differences that you must keep in mind when you do.</p><p>The first and most important difference is that overnighters are <u>not</u> considered ""tenants"" under Oregon law <u>if</u> the landlord follows Oregon's ""vacation occupancy"" requirements.  The requirements are: (1)  The ""guest"" is only staying for vacation purposes, not as a residence; (2) the guest has a principle residence other than at the park; and, (3) the guest's stay cannot exceed 45 days.  (Hint:  Make a copy of each guest's driver's license to keep on file to prove that they have a permanent residence elsewhere.)  If you ensure that the ""guest"" meets these requirements, they do not have the rights or remedies that RV tenants have under Oregon law.</p><p>If you follow these requirements, you do not have to file an eviction case if the guest fails to vacate or fails to pay.  You can simply ask that they immediately leave or have the sheriff remove them.  You should not have to worry about any ""tenancy"" complaints or threats of habitability claims, etc.</p><p>The caveat is that some sheriff officers won't make an overnighter leave, telling the park owner that it is a ""civil eviction matter.""  There are two main ways to avoid this problem.  The first is to maintain a good relationship with your local police officers.   A little bit of good will can go a long way towards gaining their cooperation with this type of problem.  The second thing to do is make sure you have the ""guest"" sign a short term RV registration agreement that acknowledges his or her status as non-tenants.</p><p>An RV registration agreement should list Oregon's vacation occupancy requirements mentioned above.  (My office or a knowledgeable attorney can easily draft a registration agreement for this purpose.)  It should also contain a specific acknowledgment that the guests are not ""tenants"" and can be immediately removed at any time.  Showing a sheriff this acknowledgment - signed by the overnighter - should make it much easier to have the sheriff show the RV'er the front gate, if necessary.</p><p>One caveat on renting RV spaces to overnighters is that Oregon law requires that bathroom facilities be provided to vacation campers.  If your park doesn'thave bathrooms available, you should not rent to overnighters.  However, depending on the circumstances, you may be able to meet this requirement with portable facilities, although always check with an attorney before making that decision. </p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; font-size: 1.1em; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);"">Mark L.

Although you might not care for the moniker, the government has officially designated you as an ""older person."" If you own property designated as housing for ""seniors,"" you should periodically refresh yourself on the state of the law protecting ""older persons"" and to avoid the mistakes of other property owners.</p>",959,994,1580,16071,column,und,Maintaining an Age-Restricted Community: A Refresher on the Housing for Older Persons Act,"<p><strong>History</strong></p><br><p>The Civil Rights Act of 1968 enacted The Fair Housing Act (""FHA"") to prohibit housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The FHA was amended in 1988 to expand its coverage to prohibit discrimination based upon disability or family status, meaning the presence of a child under the age of 18 and pregnant women. Because the creation of families as a protected class clashed with the operation of retirement or adult communities, the 1988 amendments included exemptions for housing developments that qualified as housing for persons over the age of 55. Because there was an inherent conflict between protected family status and the exemption for older persons, Congress responded with The Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 (""HOPA"")* which fine tuned the exemptions and is now the definitive authority for owners of such housing. (You should also be aware that municipalities can have ordinances prohibiting discrimination for categories broader than the Civil Rights Act. Examples of common ordinances gaining popularity are discrimination in housing on the basis of HIV/AIDS status or sexual orientation. Such ordinances are not addressed in this article.)</p><br><p><strong>Occupancy Requirement to Qualify for Exemption</strong></p><br><p>HOPA maintained the requirement that at least 80% of exempt housing must have one occupant who is 55 years of age or older. It also still required that the exempt housing publish and follow policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be housing for persons 55 and older. Significant in terms of capital costs, HOPA eliminated the requirement that 55 and older housing had to maintain ""significant facilities and services"" designed for the elderly. (Communities that are occupied solely by persons who are 62 or older are also exempt from the prohibition against family discrimination under Section 100.303.)</p><br><p><strong>The ""Wiggle Room"" Factor</strong></p><br><p>At first blush, the 80% requirement appears to give a property owner some ""wiggle room"" to comply with the exemption. HOPA specifically allows a 55 and older community to be ""exempt"" from the preference for families if, after September 13, 1988, 80% of the units are occupied by at least one person age 55 years or older. Units occupied by employees of the housing facility or community who are under age 55 do not count against the 80% as long as the employee's perform substantial duties related to the management or maintenance of the community. Likewise, units occupied by persons who are disabled and require a reasonable accommodation, also do not count against the 80%.</p><br><p>However, the 80% requirement can also be a property owners' pitfall if it is achieved improperly. The 80% requirement does not mean that the property owner can manipulate the remaining 20% of units occupied by persons under the age of 55. The 80% occupancy requirement is coupled with an additional requirement that the facility or community adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent to be a 55 or older facility. A manager cannot merely choose to rent to ""good"" non-seniors or families just because the facility is over 80% senior.</p><br><p>One provision of HOPA which, on the surface, appears troublesome is Section 100.305(h) which provides that each housing facility may determine the age restriction for units that are not occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. On its face, this provision appears to allow a community to set any age requirement it wishes for the twenty percent (20%) of spaces which are not required to be occupied by a person 55 years of age or older, including requiring the occupants of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of spaces to be adults. However, this would appear to be contrary to the general intent of the FHA to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ""family status."" A more likely interpretation is that the housing provider need not apply any age restrictions on occupancy of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of rental units. This interpretation seems likely, not only in view of the general intent of the FHA, but in view of Section 100.306(d) which provides that a housing facility or community may allow occupancy by families with children as long as it meets the intent requirements of Sections 100.305 and 100.306 (a).</p><br><p>An argument could well be made that a community must allow up to twenty percent (20%) of the spaces to be occupied by persons who do not otherwise satisfy the community's minimum age requirements. The problem is that a park which ""uses up"" its twenty percent (20%) allotment may find itself below the 80% requirement if a space which was previously occupied by a person 55 years of age or older ceases to be so occupied. This could occur as a result of an older tenant dying or moving out of the community.</p><br><p>It has been our experience that HUD has, from time to time, interpreted the ""twenty percent"" allowance as a ""fudge factor"" in order to avoid hardship where, for example, an older tenant dies, leaving a widow who does not satisfy the community's minimum age requirements. This interpretation was bolstered by the requirement that the housing be intended for persons 55 years of age or older and that the properties have rules that limit residency to persons meeting the age requirements. Deliberately allowing persons under age 55 to move into the community seems contrary to this intention.</p><br><p><em>**Tip:</em> In many states (including California) the law requires that mobilehome park owners uniformly enforce all published rules. To allow some households to avoid the requirement could run afoul of the such laws leaving the door open for a disgruntled tenant to sue on a claim that the management is not uniformly enforcing it own rules.</p><br><p><strong>Published Procedures and Policies of Intent</strong></p><br><p>In addition to requiring that at least 80% of the occupied units be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older, HOPA requires that the housing be ""intended and operated"" for persons 55 years of age or older, and that the housing facility ""publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate its intent"" to qualify for the 55 or older exemption. Section 100.306(a) sets forth a non-exclusive list of relevant factors in determining whether the park ""demonstrates"" this ""intent"":</p><br><p><em>(1) The manner in which the housing facility is described to prospective residents;</em><em>(2) Any advertising designed to attract prospective residents;</em><em>(3) Lease provisions;</em><em>(4) Written rules and regulations;</em><em>(5) The maintenance and consistent application of relevant procedures;</em><em>(6) Actual practices; and</em><em>(7) Public posting in common areas of statements describing the facility as housing for persons 55 years of age or older.</em></p><br><p>These requirements bolster the ""common sense"" approach to a community demonstrating its intent to be housing for older persons. Specifically, without limitation, the park's residency documents need to clearly state the age restrictions on residency, and the age restrictions need to be consistently enforced.</p><br><p>Unscrupulous attempts by property owners to manipulate the intent to remain senior housing have resulted in adverse judgments. In a 2003 federal case in California, Housing Rights Center et al. v. Galaxy Apartments, et al., the apartment complex and management company was sued for allegedly telling an expectant mother that it would not accept families with children because it was a ""seniors only"" complex. The Housing Rights Center sent ""testers"" to the building and learned that childless adult testers of all ages were accepted and only testers with children or who were expecting children were told that the complex was seniors only. Obviously, the apartment owner was not complying with the ""intent"" of the over 55 exemption and was ordered to pay the plaintiffs $51,000 and enter into a two year fair housing training program.</p><br><p>Some states require that housing intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older register with state agencies. You should consult your legal counsel for the applicable registration and renewal process in your state.</p><br><p><strong>Age Verification</strong></p><br><p>HOPA provides specific guidelines for ""age verification"". To protect your property, these procedures should be followed to the point that, at any given time in the past, you should be able to demonstrate, the percentage of units that were occupied by at least one person age 55 or older.</p><br><p>Section 100.307(d) provides that the following documents are considered ""reliable"" documentation of the age of the occupants:</p><br><p><em>(1) Driver's license;</em><em>(2) Birth certificate;</em><em>(3) Passport;</em><em>(4) Immigration card;</em><em>(5) Military identification;</em><em>(6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or;</em><em>(7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.</em></p><br><p>This last provision is useful in those cases where tenants who are believed to be over 55 years of age fail or refuse to provide proof of age to the park by allowing any other adult member of the household to sign a statement to the effect that the person in question is, in fact, at least 55 years of age.</p><br><p><em>**Tip</em>: Make it a policy to obtain a written application for tenancy from every household and keep those applications for the length of the tenancy.</p><br><p>Section 100.307(g) further provides that: ""If the occupants of a particular dwelling unit refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the housing facility or community may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older."" This section goes on to provide that such evidence may include government records or documents, such as a census; prior forms or applications; or a statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants. In the latter case, the individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge. Compliance with this provision most probably would be met by a park employee statement as to their opinion of the age of a tenant, based upon the tenant's appearance and, if applicable, the apparent age of the tenant's adult children.</p><br><p>A typical pitfall for owners of such properties is the HOPA requirement that the age verification information must be updated at least every two years, pursuant to Section 100.307(c).</p><br><p><em>**Tip:</em> In addition to keeping the tenant's application, the management should consider developing a form which it distributes to all spaces at least once every two years, asking residents to confirm the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home. This is probably good policy in any case, since a record of what adults are actually occupying a home is useful in other situations (e.g., naming all adult occupants in an unlawful detainer complaint).</p><br><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><br><p>While there is no guaranteed insulation from lawsuits, a property owner or landlord is well advised to have their policies and procedures in writing and reviewed by competent legal counsel. All levels of a property owners' management should be instructed to adhere strictly to those written policies and procedures. With competent advice, you should be able to avoid needless and expensive litigation which only detracts from your eventual retirement.</p><br><p>*/The Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 is codified in 24 CFR 100.300 et seq.

Leadership is defined as ""The art of leading others to deliberately create a result that would not have happened other- wise"".</p><p>Rear Admiral Grace Murry Hopper stated it simply ""you manage things; you lead people""</p><p>When we realize that many of our communities are home to more residents than some small cities in California it becomes clear that management becomes difficult and leadership becomes necessary.</p><p>Few of our communities have the staff and resources of our small municipalities. There is no police department, street department, public works, building, or fire departments, yet the needs are still there.</p><br><p>To be successful we need to value our property and our community.

A good leader will illuminate and celebrate that shared interest.</p><p>How do you lead a community?</p><p><strong>Have a vision </strong></p><p>What do you want your community to be? Communicate the vision at every opportunity. Be certain the community rules are clear and support the vision. One of the challenges of a leader is to communicate to their followers the direction and destination of the journey. Remember when you ask something of anyone, the eternal question is why.</p><p><strong>Become more knowledgeable </strong></p><p>There are an overwhelming number of laws and regulations that impact our communities. The community leaders need to be experts in this area. We have all heard that knowledge is power. That is very true. People seek out those with information. ""The road to leadership is through knowledge"".</p><p><strong>Value your residents </strong></p><p>Without residents or customers your community may be more peaceful, but will not survive. A successful community must value the residents. This sense of value must be clear and evident in every action you undertake. If you are able to convince all your residents that you value and care for their well-being you probably would have to do little more than rou- tine repairs. Unfortunately, it is not that easy to do, it takes commitment and hard work.</p><p><strong>Be positive </strong></p><p>Emphasize the great things about the community, first in your own mind and then with the residents. The positive conditions or actions include what is great now and what great plans are in the future. A word of caution on the future plans: don't ever promise what you cannot deliver.</p><p><strong>Be proactive </strong></p><p>Investigate and anticipate prob- lems or issues. There is a differ- ence between maintenance and damage control. Residents appre- ciate a quick concerned response to problems, but much prefer peace of mind. don't be shy about publicizing the actions you take to prevent problems or your efforts may go unnoticed. This is especially important if your cor- rective actions or improvements are disruptive. Let the residents know how your efforts are good for them, and that you care about their health and safety.</p><p><strong>Be fair and consistent </strong></p><p>This is sometimes a challenge. A demanding resident with a neg- ative attitude can often require more time and effort than their pleasant congenial neighbor. A good leader recognizes the obligation to lead all their followers. While residents come in all shapes, sizes and demeanors they must all be valued.</p><p><strong>Be honest </strong></p><p>Few failures are more damaging to a leader than the loss of credibility. don't promise what you can't or don't plan on delivering.</p><p>People will accept that you don't know the answer, but expect your answer if given to be accurate.</p><p><strong>Communicate, communicate and then communicate </strong></p><p>Neither the leader or follower is a mind reader. Some of the most difficult issues to resolve are those that are imagined. Make the com- munity rules and expectations clear.</p><p>Is it really possible to create or improve a sense of community? It is and it does not require large homes or a large number of homes. There are parks that contain singlewide homes that were built in the early 1960's and there are communities that contain al- most exclusively multi-wide manufactured homes on large lots. I have inspected both types of communities for compliance to the applicable health and safety standards. I have talked to residents in both types of communities. Some communities were not where most of us would want to live, but others that were not materially different had a sense of community pride that felt like home.</p><p>Where community leadership is missing I have heard resident comments such as ""the management does not care"", where you have community leadership I have heard comments such as ""this is a great place to live and all my friends wish they lived here"".</p><p>Begin your journey to a better community today.

Shortly, thereafter, his widow contacted the park owner and asked if her sister could move in with her. She was approved commencing on October 1.  However, when we asked them to come to the office and sign a new rental agreement, they balked at the provision in the MHCO form regarding trees, which provides that, with the exception of hazard trees, tree maintenance is the resident's responsibility.</p><p>Apparently, the reason for their hesitation was because, when her deceased husband was alive, the park owner had required him to cut down the trees on his space that had encroached onto the community walkway.  They ended up having to pay for repairs to the walkway which had been damaged due to the roots pushing up the cement.  Tree roots on other spaces are again encroaching into several areas of the walkway, and they are causing problems in our resident's own yard, as well. These trees, although much smaller, have been in the park for years, and were there long before the current resident and her now deceased husband.</p><p>Is this a resident responsibility or a landlord responsibility?</p>",959,994,1580,16017,column,und,Manufactured Homes and Submetering ,"<p align=""center""><strong style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Answer. </strong><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> At first blush this appears to be an issue involving ""hazard trees"" under </span><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.100"" style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">ORS 90.100(21)</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">.

That is to say, we were focusing on large limbs falling on homes, or trees becoming top-heavy from a lack pruning and trimming, and falling over entirely.  I do not recall any discussion about the root systems of trees causing dangerous conditions.</p><p>However, clearly, if the root system of a tree meeting the definition of a ""hazard tree"" causes walkways to buckle, it can create a danger to the residents and others using them.  Accordingly, under a pretty clear reading of the above-cited statutes, this appears to be a landlord issue that needs to be addressed.  As between a resident who does not own the space or the common area walkways, and the landlord who does - <em>and who presumably has the means and insurance to protect against the risk</em> - the financial responsibility rests on the latter.  It is a cost of doing business.  </p><p>However, what if the tree does <u>not</u> meet the definition of a ""hazard tree,"" is located on the resident's space, but has a root system that is encroaching up into common area walkways causing damage?  That is a more difficult issue.  I say this because if it isn'ta hazard tree, say by girth, then the resident has the trimming and pruning responsibility.  But as to that portion of the root system encroaching into the common area, I believe that is the landlord's responsibility.  Certainly, the problem did not result from a lack of resident maintenance. </p><p>My conclusion is this:  The landlord should want the common area walkways safe.  If this means cutting out the offending root system, the landlord should do so. Why, because if a resident or their guest falls and injures themselves on a broken walkway, you can be sure the landlord will be sued.  Again, it's a cost of doing business, and presumably the reason why smart landlords have good liability insurance.</p><br><br><div><br><hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> ""Diameter at breast height"" i.e. 4.5 feet.

Disputes can lead to litigation -- and litigation is expensive.  There are a few simple things that landlords can do to reduce their risk of a dispute with tenants.</p>",957,981,1583,16515,column,und,Mark Busch Article: Avoiding Tenant Disputes,"<p>The most effective solution is <u>getting good tenants in the first place</u>.  Screen each and every potential tenant for credit history, criminal convictions, and evictions.  Set your application standards and stick to them (i.e., don't fall for any ""hard luck"" stories).  There are certain restrictions on what may be considered in the evaluation process, so consult an attorney on the specifics.  (NOTE: If you charge an application fee, you must provide applicants with written notice of your screening criteria, the amount of the screening charge, your application process, and the applicant's right to dispute the accuracy of any reported information.)</p><p>After you approve an application, make sure that the tenant signs a written rental agreement, rules, and any other rental documents <u>before</u> taking possession of the rental unit.  While it is possible to establish a tenancy without any rental documents, it is always more difficult to handle potential disputes without written documentation.  don't agree to any ""informal"" tenancy arrangements - they typically lead to disputes.</p><p>After the tenancy begins, be responsive to any complaints by the tenant concerning the condition of the rental.  For example, send a handyman or contractor over to inspect and/or repair any complaints made by the tenant.  While there are limits on what constitutes a ""habitability"" issue affecting the actual livability of the rental, err on the side of making repairs unless the repair issues become unreasonable. </p><p>Finally, treat your rental like the business that it is.  If rent is due on the 1<sup>st</sup> of the month, then issue 72-hour nonpayment notices on the 8<sup>th</sup> of the month when rent is late, as allowed by Oregon law.  Address tenancy problems (i.e., unauthorized occupants, pets, maintenance issues, etc.) as soon as you learn of them.  While it might not be possible to avoid all tenant disputes, addressing problems as soon as they arise will greatly improve your legal position if you end up in court.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px; font-family: &quot;Libre Franklin&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.100000381469727px; color: rgb(35, 34, 28); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);"">Mark L.

This is a complicated area of the law and you should consult with an attorney with regard to a specific case.)</p><p><strong>What is Section 8 housing?</strong></p><p>Section 8 housing is a government assistance program that awards housing vouchers to certain low-income families to help with housing payments.  The programs are administered through local housing authority organizations, which differ from county to county throughout the state. </p><br>",957,981,1583,16255,column,und,Mark Busch Article: Section 8 Housing Assistance - Critical Information You Need to Know,"<p><strong>Does Section 8 apply to manufactured housing parks?</strong></p><p>There have been questions recently from MHCO members as to whether Section 8 housing assistance programs apply to manufactured housing facilities.  The short answer is ""yes,"" parks are required to comply with Section 8 housing requirements.</p><p><strong>Why have things changed?</strong></p><p>In 2014, the laws in Oregon changed to prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to people based on their source of income.  Before that, landlords could refuse to rent to tenant applicants if they received government rental assistance.  Now that is unlawful.  Landlords cannot refuse to rent to someone solely because they receive Section 8 rental assistance.  (And there are other government rental assistance programs that are equally protected, although Section 8 is the most common.)</p><p><strong>Why does the law apply to manufactured housing facilities?</strong></p><p>The governing Oregon statute (ORS 659A.421) prohibits discrimination based on source of income in ""real property transactions.""  This is defined to include the rental of ""vacant land"" used as the location for any building intended for occupancy as a residence (i.e., a manufactured home on a rental space).</p><p><strong>How does Section 8 work?</strong></p><p>The tenant negotiates directly with the landlord to apply for tenancy, and the landlord is entitled to screen tenants using the same rental criteria used for any other tenant applicant (i.e., criminal background, credit history, evictions, etc.).  However, the tenant's income level must include the amount received from the Section 8 assistance program.  </p><p>If approved, the tenant signs the park's regular rental agreement and other tenancy documents.  But there are <u>several important differences</u> from a non-Section 8 tenancy:</p><ol>	<li>The park will need to fill out and sign one or two short forms for the tenant to submit to the housing authority confirming that the tenant has been approved for tenancy.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""2"">The local housing authority will conduct an inspection to ensure that the ""rental unit"" is sufficiently habitable.  In an apartment setting, this would mean that the landlord would be responsible for ensuring that the apartment is fit to live in.  In a mobile home park, it means that the rental <u>space</u> (not the home itself - unless the park owns it) must simply be suitable for occupancy.  In other words, it must have the usual park-provided utility hook-ups for water, sewer, electricity, etc., and must be designed to support the installation of a mobile home in the usual manner.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3"">The housing authority will also make a determination as to whether the park's rent is a ""fair market rent.""  If they determine it is not, the housing voucher payment will not be approved.  While landlords cannot be forced to adjust their rents, they should obviously be very careful to <u>not</u> charge a higher rental amount to Section 8 applicants, which would quickly lead to a housing discrimination charge.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4"">The park will be required to sign a ""Housing Assistance Payments Contract"" which will become an addendum to the park's regular rental agreement.</li></ol><p><strong>What terms are in the ""Housing Assistance Payments Contract?""</strong></p><p>There are a number of terms, but the most important ones relate to termination of the tenancy.  For the most part, landlords can still terminate a tenancy for ""good cause"" like any other mobile home park tenant.  This can include disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of neighbors, destruction of park property, failing to maintain the rental space, and the failure to pay rent.</p><p>However, there are several potential problem areas:</p><ol>	<li>The contract requires landlords to provide a fixed-term lease of at least one year instead of a month to month rental agreement.  Since ORS 90.550 requires at least a 2-year minimum lease term for mobile home park tenants, that would need to be the stated term of the lease.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""2"">The contract states that tenancy termination must involve a ""serious or repeated violation of the lease.""  This could potentially lead to difficulties if the park needed to issue a 30-day notice for something that was a violation of the park rules, but yet does not rise to the level of a ""serious or repeated"" violation.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3"">All termination notices must be additionally served on the housing authority.  While not a significant issue, it does add another layer of administrative burden.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4"">The contract form (which is provided by HUD) is not designed for mobile home park tenancies.  It contains certain terms that would not and could apply to a mobile home park tenancy (i.e., ""The lease must specify which appliances are to be provided by the landlord""). For this reason, it would be wise to consult with an attorney before signing the HUD contract form.</li></ol><p><strong>What if the park simply refuses to sign the ""Housing Assistance Payments Contract?""</strong></p><p>If the park refused to sign the contract without good reason, it would likely lead to a housing discrimination charge.  However, in certain situations there might be legitimate legal arguments supporting this position.  Consult with an attorney before making this kind of decision.</p><p><strong>How is rent paid?</strong></p><p>Voucher amounts for rent are paid directly to the landlord by the local housing authority, with the tenant responsible for the remainder of the rent based on a percentage of their income.   </p><p><strong>What if the tenant fails to pay their portion of the rent?</strong></p><p>Since the failure to pay rent would be a serious violation of the lease, the park could issue a 72-hour notice just like it would with any other tenant.  A copy of the notice would need to be served on the housing authority as well.  (And consult with an attorney on whether the voucher payment should be returned to avoid taking a partial payment and perhaps raising a waiver issue.)</p><br><p><strong>Do these rules apply only to new tenants, or are existing tenants covered too?</strong></p><p>The statutes specifically state that a landlord cannot ""expel"" a tenant based on source of income, so the rules would cover both new and existing tenants.  This means that if an existing tenant came to the park with a Section 8 voucher application packet, the park would most likely need to comply.

The second situation is a nice lady who has moved in a boyfriend -- he seems okay but still hasn't been approved.  In both cases, they have ignored our requests to fill out a rental application.  We use MHCO Form 80 (RV Space Rental Agreement).  Is there anything in that agreement that allows us to do something about these situations?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16272,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A - Unauthorized RV Occupants,"<br><p><strong>Answer:  </strong></p><p><strong>Please note revision from last week's article: </strong> The cities of Portland and Milwaukie, Oregon have passed local ordinances that require 90-day no-cause notices regardless of the length of the tenancy.  Although of arguable legality, this would only affect RV parks located within those two cities.</p><p>Both tenants appear to be violating MHCO Form 80, Section 12 D, which prohibits any person not listed in the tenant's rental application from occupying the RV in the park.  ""Occupy"" means living in the RV more than 7 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) in any calendar year.  It is important to act quickly once you learn of an unauthorized occupant to avoid any waiver issues. </p><p>In the first situation, it seems like it would be best to simply issue a no-cause tenancy termination notice to your tenant.  The unauthorized woman is already causing problems and there is no need to give her a chance to become an approved tenant.  The no-cause notice would require them both to vacate.  If not, you could file an eviction case.</p><p>An RV tenancy (unlike a manufactured home tenancy) can be terminated with a no-cause notice if the tenancy is month to month.  If the tenant has been in the park less than a year, the no-cause notice period can be 30 days.  After the first year of tenancy, the notice period must be at least 60 days.  Use MHCO Form 43C (30/60 Day Notice to Vacate - No Cause). </p><p>(NOTE:  The cities of Portland and Milwaukie, Oregon have passed local ordinances that require 90-day no-cause notices regardless of the length of the tenancy.  Although of arguable legality, this would only affect RV parks located within those two cities.)</p><p>You could take the same approach in the second situation, although it sounds like perhaps you would like to give this tenant an opportunity to comply.  I would recommend that you speak with the tenant and explain that unless the boyfriend fills out an application for a background check, the park will have to issue a no-cause tenancy termination notice (just like in the first situation).  If he complies and passes the background check, he must sign the rental agreement as a co-tenant (as required by MHCO Form 80, Section 12 D).</p><p>A typical twist on some of these scenarios is that the occupant passes the criminal/eviction background check, but fails the credit check.  In such case, you would be perfectly within your rights under MHCO Form 80 to insist that the occupant vacate.  However, you would also have the option of allowing the occupant to stay by signing a Temporary Occupant Agreement (MHCO Form 25).  This would give you the flexibility to allow the occupant to stay, but with the requirement that he/she vacate if the tenant's tenancy ends. </p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1466467016,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13282,"<br><p><strong>Question:</strong>  I own a decent-sized RV park with quite a few long-term tenants living there, but with also a few seasonal guests and overnighters.  I have one tenant in particular who is constantly abrasive towards other tenants and guests (for example, walking thru the park and telling people that they need to fix their awnings, stack their firewood in a certain way, etc.).  He has no qualms about interjecting himself in other people's conversations even when his input is clearly unwanted.  I have already lost several tenants and others have complained.  Before this person ruins my good park, how can I get rid of him quickly?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16382,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A - What's The Quickest Way to Get a Tenant Out of My RV Park?,"<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  You haven'tindicated whether this person is a long-term tenant or perhaps just a ""vacation occupant.""  Under Oregon law, a ""vacation occupant"" is someone who: (1) Rents the RV space for vacation purposes only, not as a principal residence, (2) has a principal residence other than at the RV park, and (3) does not occupy the RV park for more than 45 days.  You would need to have these facts documented in some type of written agreement.  ""Vacation occupants"" are not ""tenants"" under Oregon law.  They can be asked to leave without any eviction proceedings and the sheriff can be called to assist if necessary.</p><p>Assuming this person is an actual ""tenant"" (weekly, monthly, or fixed-term), then in the hierarchy of the quickest ways to get him out is cash.  While this might sound counterintuitive to many landlords, I always advise my clients that it is sometimes far cheaper and quicker to get a tenant out by simply paying them to leave.  This tactic is most effective when done shortly after issuing an eviction notice to the tenant using a ""carrot and stick"" approach. If the tenant isn'twilling to settle by accepting a payment to leave, then you can rely on the eviction notice.</p><p>The type of eviction notice will depend on the type of tenancy.  Fixed-term tenants will require a for-cause notice (i.e., for breaking a park rule).  Weekly tenants can be given a 10-day, no-cause eviction notice. Monthly tenants can be evicted with a 30-day, no-cause notice during the first year of their tenancy.  After the first year, the no-cause notice to a monthly tenant would need to be a 60-day notice. (Caveat:  Portland and Milwaukie both have city ordinances requiring 90-day no-cause notices to all monthly tenants, regardless of how long they have been tenants.)</p><p>Also keep in mind that 72-hour rent nonpayment notices can be used if the tenant isn'ttimely paying the rent. This is sometimes an effective and quick tool in getting a tenant out of the park as well.  Even if you've already issued a no-cause notice, you can still use a 72-hour notice in the meantime if the tenant decides to stop paying his rent.</p><p>If the tenant refuses to vacate by the deadline in whatever eviction notice you have used, then you will need to file an eviction case against him in your county's circuit court.  That process can take anywhere from 3-6 weeks.  However, even during that period you can still use the settlement tool of a payment to have him leave if he is willing to accept.  You can point out to the tenant that if he is evicted by a court judgment, he may have a harder time finding a landlord who is willing to accept him as a tenant.</p><p>A final word of warning to seek the assistance of a competent attorney if you are unfamiliar with the strict statutory process that must be followed when issuing eviction notices.  A good attorney can also help you try to settle the case with the tenant, and ideally obtain a written settlement agreement confirming the move-out terms and releasing all legal claims between the parties relating to the tenancy.</p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1485188345,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13121,"<p>Question: A mobile home park has a separate RV section.

Many of the RV tenants are seasonal workers and usually rent a space for 3-6 months before moving on. Is it necessary to do background checks for such short-term tenants? How should the rental agreement be structured? Month to month, weekly, or fixed term?</p>",957,981,1583,15862,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: Background Checks in RV Parks,"<p>Answer: Even though some of your RV tenants are short-termers, I always recommend a complete tenant background check no matter how long the anticipated tenancy. As a businessperson, you have an obligation to yourself to ensure that every RV tenant checks out with a background screening for criminal, credit and eviction history. As a landlord, you have an obligation by law to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by not allowing ""bad seeds"" into the park.</p><p>Most problems can be avoided by doing your due diligence at the beginning of the tenancy with a proper background screening. The fact that these particular tenants are more transient than usual doesn'tmatter.</p><p>In some cases, it is even more important to check on transient tenants. By way of example, one mobile home park client allowed a woman with an RV into the park without any background check. The woman ended up being a ""professional tenant"" who worked the system and dragged out the eviction process for several months. She later popped up at another mobile home client's park and pulled the same scam.</p><p>As for the structure of the rental agreement for transient tenants, the first thing to do is use MHCO Form 80 (Recreational Vehicle Space Rental Agreement). I typically recommend a simple month to month agreement so that you can evict on 30 days' written notice if things don't work out with a particular RV tenant. Weekly tenancies are also allowable, although most RV tenants want assurances of a longer tenancy. Finally, a short fixed term tenancy (i.e., 3 months) is also acceptable so long as you're comfortable with the tenant and have done the required background checks.</p><p>Mark L.

Some use it and some don't. The problem is that it is vandalized on a regular basis and has become more trouble than it is worth. Can we close it? What about the adjacent laundry room? It's not as much of a problem, but we'd still like to just get rid of the whole facility.</p>",957,981,1583,15893,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: Can I Close That Bathroom?,"<p>Answer: Yes, you can close the restroom and the laundry facility, but you will need to jump through a few legal hoops to do it.</p><p>Under Oregon law, a landlord cannot unilaterally make a change if it ""works a substantial modification of the bargain"" unless the RV tenant consents in writing. (Note: This differs from the rule change notice and voting procedure for mobile home tenants. That procedure does not apply to RV tenants.)</p>It sounds as if both the bathroom and the laundry seem to be regularly used by at least some of the RV tenants. Those facilities are also part of each RV tenant's ""rental package"" of services or facilities provided by the park. As such, it would be a ""substantial modification of the bargain"" to unilaterally remove those facilities. Doing so could subject the park to claims of unlawful diminution of services, which might allow your RV tenants to file suit for injunctive relief preventing removal of the facilities, along with the ability to seek money damages and attorney fees.</p><p>While you could try getting the written consent of all of your RV tenants, I doubt very much that they would agree to it. Most tenants are not willing to voluntarily give up services provided as part of their rent.</p><p>My recommendation has always been to issue either 30-day or 60-day no-cause tenancy termination notices to all RV tenants, coupled with an offer to sign a new rental agreement. The new rental agreement would include a provision specifying that the park will no longer provide a public restroom or laundry. If tenants choose to stay, they would need to sign the new agreement agreeing to the change.

Community management is aware that the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to manufactured home community tenants and that the community cannot discriminate against protected groups when renting manufactured home spaces. Do the same laws apply to RV tenants? Does it matter if they are short-term vacation occupancy RVs as opposed to longer term space rental RVs?</p>",957,981,1583,15861,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: Discrimination Claims by RV Tenants,"<p>Answer: Generally the short answer is yes, the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to RV rentals. It also does not matter whether the RV rental is a vacation occupancy rental or a long-term rental. The discrimination laws apply either way.</p><p>Specifically, the Federal Fair Housing Act (""FHA"") prohibits discrimination in the rental of a ""dwelling"" based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. ""Dwelling"" includes any vacant land which is offered for lease for locating any ""structure"" on it. A structure would include an RV.</p><p>(Note: State fair housing statutes also protect against discrimination based upon race, color, sex, marital status, source of income (excluding Section 8), familial status, religion, national origin, and disability. Some local ordinances [e.g., Portland and Eugene] protect against discrimination based upon age and sexual orientation.)</p><p>As such, and as an initial matter, landlords should avoid asking any questions of RV rental applicants related to these prohibited areas. The sole exception may be the age of a potential applicant if the RV section qualifies as a ""55 or older"" facility under the Federal Fair Housing Act. The qualifications for ""55 or older"" housing are very strict and you should always check with your attorney before asking age-related questions on your rental application.</p><p>During an RV tenancy, landlords must also be careful to avoid anything that might be interpreted as discriminatory. For example, rent increases should typically be made across the board to avoid discrimination allegations. Another thing to avoid is the uneven enforcement of your rules and regulations. Every RV tenant should be held equally accountable to follow the rules, and appropriate notices should be issued to every tenant who violates the rules to leave no room for any discrimination claims.</p><p>Reasonable Accommodation</p><p>The Fair Housing Act also prohibits acts that ""discriminate against any person...  in the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a] dwelling, because of a handicap of that person or any person associated with that person."" The FHA defines discrimination as ""a refusal to make reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a [disabled] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling."" The FHA obligates landlords to make ""reasonable accommodations"" in the ""rules, policies, practices, or services,"" necessary to afford handicapped persons ""equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.""</p><p>This means that if an RV tenant requests an ""accommodation"" for his or her handicap, the landlord is obligated to provide it unless it causes a financial or administrative burden. A typical example might be if a handicapped RV tenant requested an RV rental space closest to the park's RV restrooms/showers. In most cases, the landlord would need to accommodate this request if it were possible to accommodate the request without causing a ""burden.""</p><p>However, landlords need not provide housing to individuals whose ""tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others."" A good example of this would be if an RV tenant requested to keep a pit bull as a ""companion animal."" In most instances, the landlord would be justified in rejecting this request since pit bulls are generally considered a dangerous breed.</p><p>Mark L.

Assuming the notice is properly prepared and served, the tenant has until the deadline in the notice to pay the rent in full.  If the tenant doesn'tpay, you can file an eviction case.  But even after you file an eviction, there is no guarantee that you'll get paid.  While most nonpayment eviction cases are settled with a court-approved payment plan, if not, then the court will give you possession of the RV space.  However, in most cases the court doesn'thave authority to award you a money judgment for the rent.</span></p><p>What to do now?  Look first to your security deposit to cover any unpaid rents.  If you don't have a security deposit, or if it is insufficient, you may need to file a small claims action.  Even then, the best that you can do is get a money judgment that still needs to be collected.  Bank accounts and wages can be garnished, but this whole process might be more trouble than it's worth to most landlords.  (Hint: Consider turning over cases to a collection company.  They will typically charge a high percentage fee, but recovering debts is their business.)</p><p>You also mentioned that some RV tenants owe late charges.  Since late charges are not ""rent,"" they must be handled separately.  The solution is a 30-day, for-cause notice giving the tenant 14 days to pay the late charges. A 30-day notice is also the remedy for security deposits that haven'tbeen paid, rents that are over 2 months old, and any other charges the tenant might fail to pay (e.g., NSF fees).  If a 30-day notice doesn'twork, the alternative is again an eviction case, followed by a small claims action if necessary.</p><p>But all of this still begs the question of ""how do I get paid"" when a tenant defaults.  The best remedy for every landlord is a security deposit.  There is no limit on the amount of a security deposit in Oregon, so I recommend that landlords get as much of a security deposit as they can from RV tenants, but at least enough to cover one month's rent.  The security deposit is a cushion against losses for landlords.</p><br><p>The other thing you should do as a landlord is be vigilant.  Take action on payment defaults right away and don't let them linger for months - or longer.  The longer you wait, the more you stand to lose as the unpaid charges accumulate.  (Note: There is a one-year statute of limitations to recover unpaid amounts from the date the tenant fails to pay.) </p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1417017758,1561871853,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13559,"<br><p>Question:  We have an RV tenant in our park who we would like to evict to bring in a mobile home on the space.

After the first year, the tenant cannot be evicted as long as the tenant (1) pays the rent, and (2) follows the park rules.  Since your existing RV tenant has been in the park for more than one year, you cannot evict the tenant with a no-cause notice.  </p><p>The new law forces landlords to primarily rely on for-cause notices after the first year of tenancy (i.e., rent nonpayment, violation of park rules, etc.).

By doing so, the park might inadvertently give the RV tenants more rights than they are otherwise entitled to under Oregon's Landlord-Tenant Laws.</p><p>Specifically, the MHCO manufactured home rental agreement (and most other, similar manufactured home rental agreements) typically define the rented space as being used for a ""manufactured home.""

The RV tenant's attorney could very well argue that the RV is a ""manufactured home,"" and therefore not subject to a 30-day, no-cause eviction, as RV tenants typically may be evicted.</p><p>Tenant attorneys might also try to argue that the termination provisions in a manufactured home rental agreement similarly do not allow no-cause evictions.

Is it different than evicting a manufactured home community resident?</p>",957,981,1583,15864,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: RV Tenant Eviction,"<p>Answer: The process for evicting an RV tenant is the same process used for evicting most tenants in any setting. Nearly every eviction begins with an eviction notice, which must be properly served on the RV tenant. ""Proper service"" under Oregon law means that the eviction notice must be either (1) personally served, (2) mailed by first class mail, or (3) posted and mailed (if allowed by the rental agreement).</p><p>I recommend that if the RV tenant has an individual mailbox at the park, eviction notices should be mailed with at least 3 days added for mailing time. If the tenant does not have mail service at the park, or if the mail goes through the park office for RV tenants, then personally serve the notice by putting it in his or her hand. ""Posting and mailing"" as a method of service should be avoided, since there must be very specific language in the rental agreement allowing such service.</p><p>Most notices give the tenant a certain amount of time to remedy a default (i.e., 72 hours to pay past-due rent), followed by a tenancy termination deadline if the default isn't remedied. Other notices can't be remedied (i.e., a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct) and simply inform the tenant that they must vacate by a certain time and date. RV tenants can also be evicted with a 30-day, no-cause notice if they have been in the park less than a year. Anything over a year requires a 60-day notice to evict without cause.</p><p>The one special circumstance for evicting an RV that does not require service of a notice is the so-called ""midnight move-in."" This occurs when an RV simply drives onto a space in the park without the prior consent of the landlord. When that happens and the RV owner refuses to vacate immediately, the landlord can simply file an eviction case without needing to serve any notice.<br />In all other cases, after an eviction notice expires and the RV tenant fails to vacate, the landlord will need to file an eviction lawsuit at the local county courthouse. The eviction lawsuit is sometimes referred to as an ""FED"" (""Forcible Entry and Detainer""). The tenant will be served with an eviction summons and complaint and be required to appear in court.</p><p>As the landlord, you will also need to appear in court unless you have an attorney or other agent (such as a property manager) appear in court at the ""1st appearance hearing."" This hearing is usually set 8 days after the FED is filed. The purpose of the hearing is to see whether the parties can work out a payment plan, move-out agreement, or other arrangement. If not, the case will be set for trial.</p><p>If you are unable to settle the case at the first appearance hearing, by law the trial must be scheduled within 15 days from the 1st appearance hearing. Sometimes, the parties or the court will delay the trial beyond this time frame, but most cases move quickly. This leaves little time for preparation, meaning it is important to have your witnesses, exhibits, and trial arguments ready to go.<br />You do not necessarily need an attorney for court appearances, but you will increase your chance of success if you do. The eviction statutes are very technical, and most people aren't familiar with courtroom procedures. You will especially be at a disadvantage if the RV tenant has an attorney. If your case gets to the point of a trial, it is usually worth it to hire an attorney.</p><p>Mark L.

Can we use the same forms for our RV tenants?</p>",957,981,1583,15869,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: RV Tenant Forms,"<p>Editors Note: MHCO is very happy to welcome Mark Busch as a presenter at MHCO's next mandatory training seminary in Bend on July 17th</p><p>Answer: The short answer is ""not always."" More specifically, the laws covering RV tenants are sometimes different from those covering mobile home park tenants. As such, your park will need some separate forms specifically for RV tenants, although there are certain forms that work for both types of tenants.<br />First and foremost, use a rental agreement form designed for RV tenancies. As mentioned in a previous article, MHCO Form 80 is an excellent recreational vehicle space rental agreement.<br />Beyond the rental agreement, the basic forms every RV landlord should have are tenancy application and move-in forms (i.e., MHCO Form 01 - Rental Application, Form 03 - Criminal Check Authorization, Form 10 - Application Denial). With proper training, these forms are easily filled out and used during the RV tenant application process.</p><p>You will also need eviction notice forms. Here are the most common eviction forms:</p><p>1. 72-hour rent nonpayment forms - MHCO Form 82 -(these forms can be the same for mobile home and RV tenants).</p><p>2. 30-day or 60-day no cause notice forms (these are different from mobile home park forms).</p><p>3. 30-day for cause eviction forms - MHCO Form 83 - (these are different from mobile home park forms).</p><p>4. 24-hour eviction notice forms (these forms can be the same for mobile home and RV tenants).</p><p>Keep in mind that a form is only as good as the knowledge of the person filling it out. If a form is filled out incorrectly, a landlord risks losing an eviction case to a tenant. This means that not only will the tenant be allowed to stay on the RV space, but you would also likely be held responsible for the tenant's attorney fees and court costs. These fees and costs can run several thousand dollars or more. And you have to start over with evicting the RV tenant.</p><p>The best way to ensure a legally enforceable form is to have a knowledgeable landlord attorney spend 5 minutes reviewing it before you serve it on the RV tenant. It all goes back to the old adage that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" If an attorney reviews your form before you use it, you immediately and significantly reduce the chances that you will lose an eviction case.</p><p>After you or your manager become comfortable filling out your forms, it is not as necessary to involve your attorney. Basic forms - if filled out correctly - typically present no problems later. However, it is always wise to have your attorney review eviction notices, particularly for-cause notices. For-cause notices are typically the ones most challenged by tenants and their attorneys.</p><p>A final caveat on RV forms is that you should never purchase forms online or elsewhere that are not specifically tailored for Oregon law. Such forms are typically missing provisions that are either required by Oregon law or are beneficial to landlords under Oregon law.</p><p>Mark L.

However, the greater issue is that obtaining those licenses for most companies is really a small step towards being fully compliant when acting as a creditor. Below are just a few of the other regulations that you need to follow as a creditor.</p><p><strong>1) The Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA)</strong> established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent entity housed within the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The newly created CFPB is the primary regulator for non-depository lenders with the broad authority to write rules to protect consumers, a.k.a. ""borrowers"", from unfair or deceptive financial products, acts or practices. The CFPB will be collecting, investigating and responding to borrower complaints which can be easily submitted from the comfort of a resident's home via the CFPB's website.</p><p>The CFPB will be in charge of the major consumer protection laws including RESPA, TILA, HOEPA, HMDA, SAFE, Fair Credit, Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act; Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act; Inspector General Act; Privacy Act; Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA); Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA); Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); Expedited Funds Availability Act; Fair Credit Billing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA); Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act; Federal Trade Commission Act; Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLB) and more.</p><p>This would naturally imply that if you're investigated because of a consumer's complaint stemming from a denial of credit or foreclosure, the CFPB could easily extend the investigation to include an examination of all your lending practices.</p><p><strong>2) The Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act (MDIA)</strong> requires creditors to wait 7 business days after the delivery of the initial Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement before you can close the loan. In addition, if the APR changes by more than a specified tolerance from initial disclosure you'll need to allow the borrower 3 additional business days. However, waiting periods can be shortened or waived if the extension of credit is necessary to meet a personal financial emergency. To shorten the waiver period, borrowers must prepare a signed and dated written statement, signed by all borrowers involved, detailing the specific emergency and requesting a waiver of the waiting period.</p><p><strong>3) The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) </strong>places disclosure obligations on users of consumer reports and to ensure fair, timely, and accurate reporting of credit information. This means that you are required to notify the borrower when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports, such as if you deny someone a loan or offer them a smaller loan than what they applied for. In addition, you must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the borrower. We recommend that you provide separate notices to each borrower to protect yourself from violating their privacy. There are additional criteria for those of you that furnish information to credit agencies that will land on a borrower's credit report.</p><p><strong>4) The Truth in Lending Act (TILA)</strong> applies to each individual or business that offers or extends credit more than 5 times for transactions secured by a dwelling in the preceding calendar year. There are many applicable areas within TILA depending on how your loans are structured so we'll discuss the act in a few general areas only.</p><p>- TILA limits the amount of fees that can be charged on certain transactions without additional requirements and it limits when those fees can be charged for all transactions.</p><p>- TILA mandates early disclosure of a creditor's identity, amount financed, itemization of amount financed, APR, finance charges, total of payments, payment schedule, prepayment penalties and late payment fees.</p><p>- Creditors are liable for violation of the disclosure requirements, regardless of whether the borrower was harmed by the nondisclosure.</p><p><strong>5) Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</strong> prohibits discrimination of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance. Park owners may consider a borrower's immigration status in order to ensure the borrower will be in the country long enough to repay the loan. You may not ask borrowers if they receive child support or alimony payments unless you notify them that they need only to provide this information if it will be used in determining their ability to repay. We encourage park owners to create written loan guidelines with clear underwriting standards to avoid violating fair credit laws. If you make an exception to your loan guidelines, be sure to properly document the reason for the exception and add it to the borrower's file.</p><p><strong>6) The Red Flags Rule</strong> requires creditors to implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect the warning signs of identity theft. There are four major components necessary to be compliant with the Red Flags Rule.</p><p>- First - be able to identify patterns, practices, and activity that signal identity theft.</p><p>- Second - incorporate business practices that will detect identity theft, ""Red Flags"". Park owners using our loan processing service can rest assured knowing all borrowers are run through a red flag checklist which is provided after the completion of our underwriting process.</p><p>- Third - detailed response for any red flags detected by red flags.</p><p>- Fourth - your program must be updated periodically to reflect any changes or additional information you've discovered that will help reduce identity theft.</p><p>As you may have heard, Blackhawk Capital Group has developed a comprehensive, customizable loan processing solution to meet the needs of manufactured housing community professionals selling homes on retail installment contracts. Our goal is to provide you with a full compliance solution so that you can continue doing what you do best without having to learn all of the lending laws. You continue to be the lender and after the loan closes, you also continue to service your own notes.

We've done a good job on the mobile homes, but now we're going to focus on the RVs.  One of our long-time RV tenants has a dilapidated old travel trailer that is getting worse every year.  Another newer RV resident has a decent 5<sup>th</sup> wheel, but leaves his work tools, wood scraps and other debris all over his space despite several warnings.  Do we have to give the long-time tenant the same kind of 30-day notice as mobile home tenants giving him 30 days to repair his trailer (along with the possible extension periods)?  What kind of notice should we give the newer RV tenant?</p>",957,981,1583,15928,column,und,Mark Busch Q&A: RVs: Clean It Up!,"<p>The short answer to your first question is ""no,"" you do not have to give the long-time tenant the same 30-day notice as required for mobile home tenants.  That notice under ORS 90.632 is only for mobile home tenants, not RVs.  Since RVs are not ""manufactured dwellings,"" you have some better options available.</p><p>Normally, I would recommend a 30-day, for-cause notice under ORS 90.392 requiring the tenant to repair his RV.  Presumably your park has a rule requiring homes and RVs to be kept in good repair, which you would use as the basis for the notice.  The 30-day notice would give the tenant 14 days to repair the RV or face termination of his tenancy at the end of the 30 days.</p><p><u>However</u>, in this particular case it sounds like the travel trailer has been dilapidated for quite some time.  Under ORS 90.412, you waived the right to evict the long-time tenant based on the condition of his RV by accepting rent for 3 or more months with knowledge of the condition of the RV.  That is why I always recommend addressing problems with a notice as soon as the condition arises.  (The rule is different for mobile homes - parks don't waive the right to evict even if the condition of the home has been longstanding).</p><p>Under the circumstances, your best option is to simply issue a 60-day, no-cause notice terminating the long-time tenancy.  Presumably the tenant has been there for more than one year as a month to month tenant, which requires a 60-day notice.</p><p>The newer RV tenant with the messy space is a different story.  If the condition of his space only became an issue recently, you could go with the 30-day, for-cause notice mentioned above.  The basis of the notice would be your park rules requiring tenants to maintain their spaces, along with ORS 90.325 (1)(b) which requires tenants to keep their spaces ""clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations"" of debris and rubbish.</p><p>If the messy conditions have existed for 3 or more months, then you're only left with the no-cause eviction notice option.

This new law allows landlords to require RV tenants to obtain and maintain liability insurance during their tenancy.  The amount of coverage may not exceed $100,000.  To implement this policy, landlords can give RV tenants a 30-day notice informing them of this requirement.  New RV tenants can be required to obtain insurance as long as you notify them in writing when they apply for tenancy.</p><p>If you have long-term RV tenants, it might be worthwhile to make liability insurance a requirement in your park.  It adds another layer of protection for you as a landlord if a tenant does something causing major damage or injury in the park.  (NOTE:  The law does <u>not</u> apply to mobile home park tenants.)  There are some restrictions on the insurance requirement, which we will cover in more detail at the RV seminar.</p><p align=""center""><strong>Noncompliance Fees Charged to RV Tenants</strong></p><p>There have been a few changes to the laws which allow a landlord to charge tenants a noncompliance fee for certain violations.  These fees can be a useful tool in getting tenants to follow the park rules without having to issue an eviction notice.  Landlords can charge fees for (1) late utility payments, (2) failing to pick up pet waste, (3) failing to clean up garbage, (4) parking violations, (5) improper use of vehicles on the premises, (6) smoking in non-smoking areas, and (7) keeping unauthorized pets.  The fees can't be charged without first giving a written warning and there are several other restrictions that we will cover at the RV seminar.</p><br><br><br><p align=""center""><strong>Section 8 Rental Payments</strong></p><p>A new law now makes it unlawful for you as a landlord to refuse to rent to Section 8 tenants for that reason alone.  The rationale is to give low income tenants the opportunity to rent anywhere regardless of how they make their income.  While this doesn'tusually arise in RV park rentals, all landlords should be aware of the new law.</p><p align=""center""><strong>Prior Evictions, Arrests of Crimes</strong></p><p>RV tenant applicants now cannot have their evictions considered if the case was dismissed or a judgment entered in the applicant's favor.  Eviction cases 5 or more years old at the time of the rental application similarly cannot be considered in evaluating the applicant.</p><p>The law also specifies that only certain types of crimes can be considered in evaluating an applicant: (1) Drug related crimes, (2) crimes against another person, (3) sex offenses, (4) financial fraud, and (5) a ""catchall"" provision that includes any crime that might affect the landlord's or other tenants' property or safety.  Arrests in the person's past on any of these issues that did not result in a conviction cannot be considered.  However, pending arrests that have not been adjudicated at the time of the application may be considered.</p><p align=""center""><strong>RV Restroom Requirements</strong></p><p>While not a new law, Oregon law requires that parks provide bathroom facilities to ""vacation or recreational"" campers.  Less clear is whether parks are obligated to keep or install restrooms if they only rent to long-term residential RV tenants.  At the RV seminar we will explore this issue and how it might affect your park - particularly if you have a mixed-use park of both RVs and mobile homes.</p>",839,1505,0,1500,1527,839,1,1415045779,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13030,"<br><p><strong>Question:</strong>  We have a younger gentleman who has lived in the RV section of our park now for around six months.  He checked out well in our application process, but now has not paid rent for two months.  He says that he was laid off from his job, but is starting a new one and that his mother has agreed to help him catch up.  But that was several weeks ago and still nothing.  We don't necessarily want to evict him, but this obviously can't continue.  Any advice?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16130,column,und,"Mark Busch Q&A: Stay and Pay"" Court Agreements""","<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  You are right that it can't continue - this is your business and you need to treat it as a business.  However, there is a chance that you can give this tenant an opportunity to redeem himself, yet still protect your interests as well.</p><p>The first step is to give the tenant a 72-hour rent nonpayment notice.  Use MHCO Form 82, fill it in following the directions on the form, and serve it on the tenant.  If the tenant pays the rent by the 72-hour notice deadline, then life goes on and the tenancy continues.  If not, you should file an eviction case at your county courthouse. </p><p>The court clerk will have several ""check the box"" forms that you can use to file an eviction - but be sure to bring along several copies of the 72-hour notice that you will need to attach to the eviction complaint.  After you file the paperwork and pay the filing fee, you can then have the sheriff serve the eviction summons and complaint.  The court clerk will be able to show you to the sheriff's office to have them serve the paperwork.</p><p>The court clerk will set a ""1<sup>st</sup> court appearance hearing"" when you file the eviction complaint.  Both sides need to show up at this hearing.  If the tenant doesn'tappear, then you win automatically and get a judgment entitling you to an eviction by the sheriff.   The court clerk can give you the paperwork to finish that process.</p><p>If the tenant does show up, you will get a chance to negotiate a ""stay and pay"" agreement that the court will sign off on as an enforceable court order.  (Most courts will have a form that you can use for this agreement.)  Under Oregon law, the payment agreement can and should include:  (1) All past-due rent; (2) late fees; (3) unpaid utilities; (4) court costs; (5) attorney fees (if any); and, (6) any other unpaid charges.  The payment agreement can extend for up to six months, with payments made at monthly intervals or any other schedule that both sides agree on.  The agreement can also include the next three regular monthly rent payments, sort of a ""probationary period"" to make sure the tenant gets back on track.</p><p>If the tenant complies with the payment terms, the tenancy continues and the court will automatically dismiss the eviction case after the payment agreement expires.  If the tenant misses any payment, then you will file a ""declaration of noncompliance"" with the court and finish the eviction process.</p><p>These ""stay and pay"" agreements are very useful to my landlord clients and I use them regularly.  They give you an opportunity to keep good tenants that may have temporarily fallen on hard times, but also keep open your eviction options.</p><p>As the landlord, you will also need to appear in court unless you have an attorney or other agent (such as a property  manager) appear in court at the ""1st appearance hearing."" This hearing is usually set 8 days after the FED is filed. The purpose of the hearing is to see whether the parties can work out a payment plan, move-out agreement, or other arrangement. If not, the case will be set for trial.</p><p>If you are unable to settle the case at the first appearance hearing, by law the trial must be scheduled within 15 days from the 1st appearance hearing. Sometimes, the parties or the court will delay the trial beyond  this time frame, but most cases move quickly. This leaves little time for preparation, meaning it is important to have your witnesses, exhibits, and trial arguments ready to go.</p><p>You do not necessarily need an attorney for court appearances, but you will increase your chance of success if you do. The eviction statutes are very technical, and  most  people aren't  familiar with courtroom procedures. You will especially be at a disadvantage if the RV tenant has an attorney. If your case gets to the point of a trial, it is usually worth it to hire an attorney.</p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1438180137,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13002,"<p align=""center"">Question: We have a parking problem in our RV park.  Some of the long-term residents often have guests who park in places that they shouldn't.  In addition, some tenants own more than one vehicle, which adds to the parking congestion.

Also contact a local towing company to have them post towing company signs around the park.</p><p>When you have an illegally parked vehicle towed, the towing company is responsible for taking a photo of the vehicle and reporting to the police that it has been towed.  After the car is removed, the towing company takes responsibility for the vehicle and returning it to the owner (after paying the tow fees, of course).</p><p>I would also suggest a rule allowing the park to assess parking violation charges of $50 per violation.  As required by ORS 90.302 (3), the rule should specify that the first violation would result in a written warning, with subsequent violations within one year being assessed the $50 charge.  ORS 90.302 (3) specifies the language that must be included in the written warning, which you should consult with an attorney to draft.</p><p>There are certain technical nuances to these statutes, so as usual consult with an experienced attorney before implementing a parking enforcement plan.

Answer: ""It de- pends."" If your mobile home park pre-dates the ADA statute, and the Park has not gone through any significant renovations (deter- mined on a case-by-case basis), then the park may be ""grandfathered in"" in most cases. However, there can still be considerations of ""reasonable accommodation"" and ""readily achievable barrier removal"" under the ADA that could require a park owner to make modifications to existing structures and to make existing buildings ""accessible"" to the disabled. There may be no ""grandfathering in"" under these provisions of the ADA. In addition, if the park has undergone sub- stantial alterations/renovations, this could also trigger ADA com- pliance. A mobile home park owner might also ask ""If my park needs to comply with ADA issues, then does the park have to comply with the 1991 Regulations or the 2012 Regulations?"" Once again, the answer is ""it depends."" There is a broad ""grandfather"" clause that exempts all building elements constructed in compliance with the 1991 Regulations until those elements are subject to a planned alteration.</p><p>So--is a mobile home park a ""place of public accommodation"" or not? The ADA defines a ""public accommodation"" to be ""a private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation."" Examples of places of ""public accommodation"" include places of lodging; establishments serving food or drink; places of exhibition or entertainment; places of public gathering; sales or rental establishments; service establishments; stations used for public transportation; places of public display or collection; places of public recreation; places of public education; social service center establishments; and places of exercise or recreation. Does a mobile home park fit within these descriptions? Based on discussions with ADA experts,the typical mobile home park does not appear to ""fit"" under any of the enumerated examples of a ""public accommodation,"" assuming the park's facilities are only open for the sole use and enjoyment of the park's residents, rather than the ""general public."" In some cases, however, a park's clubhouse and office could be determined to be ""public accommodations"" as they are generally ""opened to the pub- lic."" In addition, the park's office is necessarily ""opened to the pub- lic"" as persons, not otherwise residents of the park, are allowed in and, in fact, are invited in to inquire about available spaces and/or mobile homes in the park. One issue which has been ""rearing its ugly head"" recently in connection with what are referred to as ""drive-by"" ADA lawsuits is the inadvertent conversion of a ""non-public"" ac- commodation to a ""public"" accommodation. For example, if the park clubhouse is not open to the general public, but the park allows the clubhouse to be used as a polling station for elections, or for classes for the local college, or for swimming lessons in the pool, the park may have inadvertently converted the area to a ""public"" accommodation and will be required to comply with the ADA for the impacted area, e.g., pool or clubhouse. Even the ""innocent"" re- quest by one person to use the ""private"" restroom at the management office could trigger thousands of dollars in improvements to make the restroom ""accessible"".</p><p>If the park has ""public accommodations"" which have ""barriers"" to ""access,"" then the next consideration is whether the ""removal of the barrier"" is ""readily achievable."" Remember that these barriers apply to all sorts of disabilities, including sight and hearing, and not just accessibility for wheel chairs. The ADA generally defines ""readily achievable"" as easily accomplished and able to be carried out with- out much difficulty or expense. 42 U.S.C.S. _ 12181(9). Federal courts have developed several factors in determining what is ""readily achievable"": (1) nature and cost of the removal; (2) overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved; (3) number of persons employed at such facility; (4) effect on expenses and re- sources; (5) impact of such action upon the operation of the facility; (6) overall financial resources of the covered entity; (7) overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; (8) the number, type, and location of its facilities; (9) type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including com- position, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; and (10) geographic separateness, administrative or fiscal relation- ship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity. Col- orado Cross Disability Coalition v. Hermanson Family Ltd. Pshp. The park however will bear the ultimate burden to prove that the barrier removal is not readily achievable. This will be determined on a case- by-case basis for each individual park. The 1991 Regulations pro- vide examples of steps that may be ""readily achievable"" according to the Department of Justice.</p><p>So, how do you lessen the chance of your park becoming a ""tar- get"" of an ADA lawsuit? There are no ""bright lines"" as to whether a park has ADA issues or not. Since an ""ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" the prudent park owner might be best served by hiring a knowledgeable ADA Consultant to review and comment on whether the park has any ADA issues and how they should or could be addressed. California has implemented a Certified Access Specialist (""CASp"") training and licensing program, which provides incentives (i.e., some protections from lawsuits) for property owners who conduct a CASP inspection. Another, and more conservative approach would be to simply make sure that all of the park facilities are ""ADA compliant,"" even if, technically and legally, you may not be required to do so. Little things can make a big difference in your park. Examples of ADA compliance include: levers on the entrance doors; levers on bathroom doors and fixtures; bathroom fixtures at proper height; proper bathroom accessories; doorways that accept wheelchair access; bathrooms that accept wheelchair access; counters at correct height for wheelchairs users; alternatives (ramps/elevators) to steps into the clubhouse and office; acceptable transitions (no lips) at doorways (interior and exterior); accessible parking and van access spaces; acceptable transitions (commonly referred to as ""curb cuts"") to sidewalks at street junctions and accessible parking; and acceptable inclines from parking areas to the park's ""public accommodations,"" to name a few.</p><p>Your ADA consultant can walk your park and let you know what facilities do and do not comply with ADA. Making the necessary improvements will be money well spent, and potentially ""ward off' ex- pensive litigation, which litigation, in all probability, will not be covered by your general liability insurance policy. You might also want to turn this into a ""PR plus"" for your park - i.e., tell your res- idents about the improvements after they are done! However, such actions may not be right for every park. The park owner should first discuss ADA considerations with its legal counsel to determine what the right course of action is under the particular circumstances.</p><p>In addition, insurance is playing an ever more important role in protection against ADA claims. More and more often, ADA plain- tiff lawyers are adding causes of action for negligence and alleging bodily injury to trigger the potential for coverage under the park owners CGL policies. Our recommendation is to tender any ADA claims to your carrier immediately. In addition, some insurers now offer what is known as ""tenant discrimination"" insurance, which may pro- tect the park owner in the event of an ADA claim since the ADA claim is a civil rights claim. We suggest all park owners speak with their industry insurance broker about possible insurance protection.</p><p>John Pentecost is a partner with Hart, King &amp; Coldren, a law firm located in Santa Ana, California.

What are the rules for raising rent?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16417,column,und,Mark Busch RV Q&A - Raising Rents on RVs,"<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  It is now statewide law that rents cannot be raised at all during the first year of a month-to-month tenancy.  After the first year of the tenancy, you are required to give written notice to the tenant at least 90 days prior to the effective date of the rent increase.</p><p>The written rent increase notice to tenants must state (1) the amount of the rent increase; (2) the amount of the new rent; and, (3) the date on which the increase becomes effective.  If the notice is mailed to the tenants, you must add at least three additional days to the notice period (not counting the date mailed) to allow for mailing.  The notice can also be hand-delivered to the tenants, but this means putting it directly in the tenant's hand - posting the notice is legally ineffective.</p><p>If you happen to have any fixed-term tenancies, be aware that rent can only be raised for those tenants in accordance with whatever the rental agreement says concerning rent increases.  Week-to-week tenants can have their rent raised with at least seven days' written notice prior to the effective date of the increase.  The same rules apply regarding the information that must be in the notice (amount, new rent, effective date), and regarding additional mailing time for the notice.</p><p>There is currently no limit on the amount of a rent increase, although there are rent control measures under consideration in the Oregon legislature.  <u><strong>With that in mind, beware that any rent increase that you issue before the legislature adjourns might be subject to new laws.  Check in on the MHCO website to keep apprised of any legislative changes.</strong></u></p><p>Special rules also apply within the Portland city limits.  By ordinance, a rent increase of 10% or more within a 12-month period triggers the tenant's right to terminate the tenancy on 14 days' written notice and potentially receive a ""relocation assistance"" payment from the landlord. These payments are based on the size of the rental unit and start at $2,900.  However, it is questionable whether the ordinance as written applies to RV tenancies.  If you intend to issue a rent increase of 10% or more within the City of Portland, you should first consult with a knowledgeable attorney to assess the risk of being subject to relocation payments.</p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1494942529,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13014,"<p align=""center""><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Question:  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Our RV park allows pets, but we have a specific rule that prohibits dangerous breeds, including pit bulls.

As such, you are probably obligated under federal law to let her to keep the pit bull.</p><p>However, one reason for challenging a reasonable accommodation is on the disability diagnosis.  In other words, did the tenant's doctor actually make a verifiable diagnosis, or did the tenant just get an online ""prescription"" without even meeting the tenant?  If that is the case, you might consider consulting your attorney on challenging the request since HUD has stated that the tenant must submit <u>reliable</u> documentation of a disability and the need for an assistance animal.</p><p>I have also advised clients that it is sometimes possible to remove an assistance animal if it poses a threat to other residents.  However, this <u>can'</u> be based on the particular breed of dog, but must instead be based on the attributes of the <u>specific animal in question</u>.  For example, if the dog lunged at or attacked another resident, you could likely have it removed.</p><p>Along these lines, I recommend that you arrange a meeting with the tenant to ""meet"" the dog.  The purpose (which you can explain to the tenant) is to ensure that her particular dog complies with federal law by not posing a threat to other residents.  Assuming the dog does not display any vicious tendencies, it complies and can stay (although any future incidents could lead to a re-evaluation).  You can also require her to keep the dog on a leash, clean up after it, and otherwise adhere to any reasonable pet rules you might have.  You cannot, however, require any sort of pet deposit or other fee since the dog is considered an assistance animal, not a pet.</p><p>A final issue to consider is whether a pit bull in your RV park might cause your insurance rates to rise.  If that is the case, you should consult your attorney on whether that rate increase might be considered an undue financial burden on the park.  If so, you could possibly deny the pit bull on that basis.</p><p>The moral of this question is that each and every reasonable accommodation case is different.  Talk to your attorney before denying a tenant's request so that you can avoid a HUD investigation.</p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1432736894,1561871853,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12886,"<p>Question: Can our park use the regular MHCO manufactured home rental agreement for RV tenants who are allowed in certain spaces throughout our manufactured home park?</p>",957,981,1583,15986,column,und,Mark Busch RV Q&A: Do I Need a Security Guard?,"<p>Answer: No, the park should definitely not use a regular manufactured home rental agreement for RVs.

If everything checks out, have his guests sign a temporary occupancy agreement (MHCO Form 25).</p><p>The reindeers are definitely a problem.  If you're okay with them being there, have Kris fill out a pet agreement (MHCO Form 21).

If you fit these requirements, call the tow company and they will put that eyesore in the impound lot.</p><p>The wild card here is if Kris happens to break into your park office and leaves a lump of coal in your stocking.

While we already have a number of long-time residents in regular RVs, but we want to expand into the ""park model"" business to become a more attractive option for that segment of the market.  Can we treat regular RVs and park models the same under the landlord-tenant laws?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16160,column,und,Mark Busch RV Q&A: Park Models in an RV Park,"<p><strong>Answer:  </strong>The general answer is ""yes,"" both the park models and regular RVs can (and should) be treated the same with regard to landlord-tenant laws.  However, there are certain regulations that you must follow to ensure that the park models fully qualify as ""recreational vehicles"" as defined by Oregon law.</p><p>First and foremost, a ""recreational vehicle"" is defined by statute (ORS 446.003 (33)) as a vehicle ""with or without motive power that is designed for human occupancy and to be used temporarily for recreational, seasonal or emergency purposes"" and as further defined by administrative rule.  ""Recreational vehicle"" is then defined in various rules as (1) being identified as an RV by the manufacturer, and (2) <u>not exceeding 400 square feet in the setup mode</u>, including all tip-outs, slide-outs, expandable rooms, and other horizontal projections.</p><p>However, this does not mean that park models cannot be equipped with various accessory structures like decks, steps, porches, roof overhangs and other similar construction.  The guiding rule is that these external structures cannot be supported by the RV itself and cannot be enclosed with walls, glass or other solid materials if that would exceed the maximum allowed gross floor area of the RV. </p><p>While there are other construction exceptions as well (basements, lofts, certain bay windows, freestanding cabanas, etc.), you should consult with a knowledgeable expert to carefully comply with these regulations.  The primary Oregon Administrative Rules can be found at OAR 918-525 and 918-530, which are administered by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, Building Codes Division.</p><p>Assuming you meet the park model regulations, you can use the same rental agreement that you use with regular RV tenants.  In many cases, MHCO Form 80 (RV Space Rental Agreement) will work just fine.  In other cases, you may want to use a form specifically designed for your park - just make sure that it contains all of the required information, such as how accessory buildings and structures will be dealt with at the end of the tenancy.</p><p>In any event, an RV tenancy (unlike a manufactured home tenancy) can be terminated with a no-cause notice if the tenancy is month to month.  If the tenant has been in the park less than a year, the no-cause notice period can be 30 days.  After the first year of tenancy, the notice period must be at least 60 days.  While you would certainly hope not to need to evict a park model tenant, since they technically live in ""recreational vehicles,"" the law gives you that option as a landlord.</p>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1442423788,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13225,"<p>Question:  We are wondering whether to use monthly or weekly rental agreements with RV tenants?

Any recommendations?</p><br>",957,981,1583,16325,column,und,Mark Busch RV Q&A: RV Tenancies Month-to-Month or Week-to-Week?,"<p>Answer:  You've already recognized that it really is a matter of personal preference and how each type of tenancy fits into your park's business model.  There is certainly an advantage to having long-term tenants so that you have less turnover and you develop a good reputation as an option for residents who plan on staying awhile.</p><br><p>However, month-to-month tenants can only be evicted without cause on 30 days' written notice during the first year of the tenancy, and on 60 days' notice after the first year of tenancy.  (<u>But see</u> special note below for Portland and Milwaukie landlords.) Additionally, state law now prohibits rent increases on monthly RV tenants during the first year of the tenancy and requires 90 days' written notice to raise the rent after the first year.</p><br><p>Conversely, week-to-week tenancies make it easier to evaluate a tenant in the short-term to ensure that he or she will work out in the long run.  Weekly tenants can be evicted for no cause on 10 days' written notice and rent can be increased on 7 days' written notice.  These are significant advantages when evaluating tenants as possible long-term residents.</p><br><p>The primary disadvantage in creating weekly tenants is the administrative burden.  To create a week-to-week tenancy in Oregon, it must have <u>all</u> of the following characteristics: (1) occupancy charged on a weekly basis and payable no less frequently than every seven days; (2) a written rental agreement that defines the landlord's and the tenant's rights and responsibilities under Oregon law, and (3) no fees or security deposits, although the landlord may require the payment of an applicant screening charge.</p><br><p>In your situation, it might make sense to put new tenants on weekly agreements at least initially.  If they seem to be working out, you can then offer them a new, monthly agreement later.  MHCO Form 80 [Recreational Vehicle Space Rental Agreement] can be used for either weekly or monthly tenants.  Just be sure to properly fill out the form and do <u>not</u> charge weekly tenants a security deposit or other fees (or you risk automatically making them monthly tenants right away).</p><br><p><u>Special Note Regarding RV Parks in Portland and Milwaukie</u>: These two cities have enacted local ordinances that override state law and require a minimum of 90 days' written notice for no-cause evictions from the very beginning of a month-to-month tenancy.

Use MHCO Form 43C for no-cause RV evictions, choosing either the 30-day or 60-day notice option, depending on the length of tenancy.</p><p>Caveat:  Portland and Milwaukie both have ordinances requiring 90-day no-cause notices to <u>all</u> monthly tenants, regardless of how long they have been tenants.  The City of Bend requires 90-day notices after the first year of tenancy.  In addition, Portland requires landlords to make ""relocation assistance"" payments to tenants evicted for no-cause, ranging from $2,900 to $4,500 - although the applicability of this requirement to RV tenants is legally questionable. <u>Bottom line</u>: Consult an attorney if you have an RV park in any of these cities.</p><p>If you have any week-to-week RV tenants, they can be evicted with a 10-day, no-cause notice.  This applies even in the municipalities mentioned above, which all provide exceptions for weekly tenants.  However, remember that to have a valid ""week-to-week"" tenancy, you must meet these specific requirements: (1) Occupancy is charged on a weekly basis and is payable no less frequently than every seven days, (2) there is a written rental agreement defining the landlord's and tenant's rights and responsibilities, and (3) there are no fees or security deposits (other than applicant screening charges).  If your weekly tenant arrangements do <u>not</u> meet these specific requirements, your tenants will be treated as month-to-month tenants under Oregon law.</p><p>If you happen to have any fixed-term RV tenants, you cannot evict them with a no-cause notice until the fixed-term ends.  Before that, it would require a for-cause notice (i.e., for breaking a park rule or for not paying the rent). </p><p>Finally, there is also an exception under Oregon law for RV ""vacation occupants.""  A ""vacation occupant"" is someone who: (1) Rents the RV space for vacation purposes only, not as a principal residence, (2) has a principal residence other than at the RV park, and (3) does not occupy the RV park for more than 45 days.  You would need to have these facts documented in a written agreement.  ""Vacation occupants"" are not ""tenants"" under Oregon law.

If the tenant is <u>within the first year of occupancy in the park</u>, you can evict with a 30-day, no-cause eviction notice (MHCO Form 43 C).</p><p>(Caveat:  Portland and Milwaukie both have ordinances requiring 90-day no-cause notices to <u>all</u>monthly tenants, regardless of how long they have been tenants.  In addition, Portland requires landlords to make ""relocation assistance"" payments to tenants evicted for no-cause, ranging from $2,900 to $4,500 - although the applicability of this requirement to RV tenants is legally questionable. Consult an attorney if you rent RV spaces in either of these cities.)</p><p>Unfortunately, due to recently enacted Senate Bill 608, you no longer have the right to evict a month-to-month tenant for no-cause <u>after</u>the first year of occupancy except in very limited circumstances that do not likely apply in your case (i.e., the RV park is being closed and converted to a nonresidential use).  Instead, Senate Bill 608 now forces landlords to primarily rely on for-cause evictions after the first year of the tenancy.</p><p>In your particular case, you should issue a 72-hour rent nonpayment notice each and every month that the tenant is late with the rent (MHCO Form 82).  If rent is due on the first day of the month, you can issue a 72-hour notice as soon as the eighth day of the month.  At some point, you may catch the tenant missing the payment deadline in the 72-hour notice, after which you can file an eviction action in court.</p><p>If allowed by the tenant's rental agreement, you should also assess a late fee every month.  If the tenant fails to pay the late fee as required by the rental agreement, you should issue a 30/14-day, for-cause notice to the tenant requiring payment of the late fee.  Under ORS 90.392 (4), if the tenant does not pay the late fee within 14 days after delivery of the notice, the tenancy terminates 30 days after the notice was delivered.</p><p>You are correct that the ""three strikes"" law does not apply to an RV tenant.  Only manufactured home tenants can be evicted with a 30-day notice after receiving three or more 72-hour notices within a 12-month period.  As such, RV park landlords must rely on the strategies outlined above to evict month-to-month tenants on late rent payments.</p><p>One final strategy for the future is to consider using a fixed-term rental agreement.  Senate Bill 608 does allow a landlord to evict a tenant at the end of the fixed term with a 90-day notice if the tenant has committed three or more violations of the rental agreement within the preceding 12 months.  You must give a written warning for each violation that specifies the violation, states that three or more violations within a 12-month period may result in termination of the tenancy at the end of the fixed-term, and states that correcting the third or subsequent violation is not a defense to the termination.  While this would not help in your current situation, it could be used with future tenants if you choose this strategy of using fixed-term leases.</p><p>As usual, you should always seek the advice of a knowledgeable attorney if you are unsure whether to issue an eviction notice to an RV tenant, have questions on what kind of eviction notice to issue, or need guidance to use fixed-term agreements for future residents.</p><br>",23,1505,0,1500,1527,23,1,1556497170,1562265641,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12979,"<p>Question: We're concerned that with the passage of Oregon's new marijuana laws, we'll have some tenants using marijuana in the RV park and maybe even growing it.

In addition, Oregon's new marijuana law (Measure 91) specifically includes a provision prohibiting its application to any state or federal law pertaining to landlord-tenant matters.</p><p>This means that because marijuana production or use is illegal under federal law, landlords may continue to prohibit it on rented premises.

Picture a diagram that consists of a huge wheel.  There is a hub in the very center. It is a small circle.  You are this hub.  Radiating outward from this hub are eleven spokes that then connect with a huge wheel on the outside.  Each of the eleven spokes is one of the areas of promotion we are going to discuss in this handbook.  The huge wheel on the outside is your market: the general public, the planning and zoning officials. </p><br><p>In other words, this huge wheel is a never-ending stream of potential customers.  This huge wheel also makes up the members of the general public at large.  Everyone has an opinion.  On this huge wheel, everyone has an opinion about manufactured housing and manufactured home communities.  Part of a successful promotion and marketing program is to create more and more favorable opinions of the general public that is part of that huge wheel. </p><br><p>When the one of the eleven spokes joins the wheel, a direct line of vision, understanding and agreement is created between the hub (you) and the wheel (your market).  Both ends of the spoke (you in the hub and the general public on the wheel) then see things the same way.  The conduit that enables this ""coming together"" of opinion is the spoke that links you in your hub with your potential customer on the huge wheel.  When this happens, you have successfully created a promotion (being noticed) that may result in effective marketing (a sale or lease).   The other positive side effect is usually the creation of a more favorable image of the manufactured housing industry as a whole.</p><br><p>When the public that is represented by the wheel is comprised of elected officials, your promotional efforts may result in positive zoning decisions or approval of expansion plans for a new community.  When that public represents your customer, you will have created a sale of a home or a lease of a homesite.  We need all kinds of people from this public arena on our side.</p><br><p>This illustration gives you a visual image of the way a successful promotion can take you where you have never been before - or leave you spinning around in circles.  You are in the center ring.  Take charge of your promotional efforts.  Create new markets.  Realize new growth opportunities.  Change the image of manufactured housing.  It all starts with you!</p><br><p>A successful promotion and marketing program will affect your staff, your community, your residents, their friends, their co-workers and families, the surrounding business community, and the industry as a whole in a positive way.  It will help change the perception of manufactured housing in the eyes of the uneducated public, the elected officials, and increase the number of homeowners.  Your successful promotion and marketing program will generate a continued bottom-line growth for your community and your company while providing housing that is perceived as a <u>true value</u> by your customers.</p><br><p>And, by the same token, an unsuccessful promotion and marketing program - or the total lack of one - can keep your community frozen in time.  It can perpetuate a negative image of the industry.  It will hamper your efforts in expansion, fill or upgrade.  It will prevent you from reaching the highest level of personal and professional excellence that is obtainable.  To be more blunt, the lack of a promotion and marketing program that does good means you, your community, and the industry will suffer.

Often the most important factor is not what you say, but how you say it. For example, if you remain calm, with no anger in your voice, you probably can defuse an agitated resident.  To help eliminate misunderstandings you must respect the compliant or the message given to you, then clarify it so that both sides understand what is being said.  Let the resident know you are listening to them and make them aware that they are being heard.</span></span></p><br><h2> </h2><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Nonverbal Communication</span></strong></span></h2><br><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Nonverbal communication can sometimes reveal more about what you are saying than words you actually speak.  Gestures, postures, appearance and facial expressions are examples of nonverbal communication that you should be aware of.  Also, it is important that you maintain eye contact with the resident while he or she is speaking.  This indicates to them that you are paying attention to what they are saying and that you are interested.</span></span></p><br><h2><strong><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Written Communication</span></span></strong></h2><br><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Written communication will play an important role in developing good resident relations.  This is an effective way to get across a message or make a point.  Your correspondence should be in a short, concise manor and preferably no longer than one page.  You should be direct and courteous; avoid being rude, negative or accusatory.  Whenever possible, start and end your correspondence with a neutral or positive statement.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">While written communication is necessary, it should be not substituted for face-to-face contact.  We often see owners and managers try to avoid speaking directly with residents by sending them a written notice or violation letter.  The problem with written communication like this is you cannot get all the facts and there may be a reasonable explanation of a violation of which you were unaware.  This makes you look uninformed and leaves a negative impression on the resident.  Giving residents positive feedback can also help in developing better relationships. If a resident maintains a nice clean space, you should tell them.  This lets them know you care and encourages them to continue the positive behavior.  After a resident complies with a request to clean up their space, let them know how great it looks and how much you appreciate their cooperation.</span></span></p><br><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">In Conclusion</span></strong></span></h2><br><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Good resident relations require a well thought-out plan and a commitment on your part to make it work.

""Or, you are in your office with a prospect when your most demanding resident bursts in demanding to speak with you.  Sound familiar?</p><p>Simply put, controlling conflict is part of the job. Residents, Prospects, Vendors, and even other team members can be sources of conflict for us.  Conventional wisdom (and research) says that good communication can improve relationships, increasing trust and support. The converse is also true: poor communication can weaken bonds, creating mistrust and even contempt.</p><br><p>If we know that communication is the key to eliminating, or at least minimizing conflict, why can it be so difficult?  It's typically because we have a very clear idea of ""our side"" of the argument.  To solve a problem, it helps to stop for a moment to wonder what the other person us thinking.  Here are some tips:</p><br>",959,994,1580,16654,column,und,MHCO Article: Taking Conflict to Cooperation,"<ol>	<li>Empathy</li></ol><p>We have all heard the expression, ""put yourself in the others' shoes"", and this is great advice when dealing with a conflict.  This does not mean you must agree with the other person, but by placing yourself in their situation you are demonstrating your desire to solve whatever problem they have brought to you.  </p><br><ol>	<li value=""2"">Improve Your Listening Skills</li></ol><p>It is important to develop active listening skills.   Glancing at your phone or computer screen while a resident is trying to talk to you is not only disrespectful, you are probably adding fuel to their already heightened sense of aggravation.  When possible move the conversation away from a desk so that there is a level playing field without a barrier to communication. Try repeating back to them ""Here is what I heard you say, is that correct?"".  This solidifies that you are paying attention and that their issue is important to you. </p><br><ol>	<li value=""3"">Keep Your Emotions In Check</li></ol><p>Okay, so this is a hard one!  You work hard and take pride in your job.  It is only natural for you to defend and protect your livelihood.  It is vital that you do not jump to any conclusions and stay focused on the matter. You can achieve this by asking questions and taking notes to assure that you are understanding all the information correctly.  If you allow yourself to get defensive the situation will only escalate and remember, you are there to solve the conflict, not make it worse.  Many people have a difficult time expressing themselves, and the same words may have different meanings to different people.  When our emotions are engaged, we tend to hear only what we want to hear.  This can trigger our ""flight or fight"" response and this will add to the conflict rather than solve it.  Monitor your voice tone and volume, be ready to listen, and then speak to be understood.</p><br><ol>	<li value=""4"">Cooling Off Difficult People</li></ol><p>There will always be loud and inflexible customers who feel that they have been treated poorly, or have preconceived ideas about you and your company. Some people are just difficult! We need to focus on our job:  reaching a deeper understanding of the issue and solve it.  This means listening attentively, do not interrupt, let them vent, and acknowledge how important the issue is and reflect it to them. Remind them that you there to find a solution and focus on the things we CAN do to help.</p><p>This does not mean you must sit there and accept any abuse from anyone.  If a customer is verbally abusive you should remain civil, but tell then the truth about the effect of their attitude.  Try this: ""I care very much about your problem but when you speak to me this way I find it difficult to focus on a solution"".  This is a solution oriented response that lets them know that you will not tolerate any more of their verbal attacks.</p><p>Document the conversation.</p><br><ol>	<li value=""5"">Stay Calm and Move On</li></ol><p>Here is the good news - not every customer interaction is negative.  It's just that those situations are so unpleasant we tend to dwell on them. Self-preservation demands that you stay calm - take a deep breath, don't take it personally, take a break, and don't repeat the story to everyone you see for the rest of the day. This behavior will intensify your emotions and it becomes the proverbial ""fish"" story.  The more you tell it, the bigger the story becomes. Continually reliving the incident can change what really happened into a story you have told yourself.  Focus on the positives and solutions that emerged from the incident and take pride in handling the situation.</p><p> Take some advice from Taylor Swift and ""Shake It Off""!</p><br><p>Being polite goes a long way towards appropriately dealing with difficult people and resolving conflict. Work to maintain your sense of humor and difficulties will roll off your back much easier. Increasing your problem-solving skills will significantly reduce problems in your community, as well as show your employer that you are representing them in a positive and productive manner.  </p><p><em>Angel Rogers has over 25 years of Property Management experience.

An eviction (formally known as a ""forcible entry and detainer"" or ""FED"") is an expedited legal procedure designed to allow landlords to obtain possession of their property through the court system.  When the eviction involves a space at a manufactured housing community, it is the <u>space</u>, not the home, that is returned to the landlord.  Following a successful eviction, the court will render a ""judgment of restitution"" to the landlord.  This means that the space will be restored back to the landlord and the tenant's right of possession to the space has been taken away.  However, this leaves the issue of the manufactured home sitting on the space.  Does an evicted tenant have any further rights to the home, and if so, how are those rights exercised?  It is the abandonment process described in ORS 90.675, that addresses this issue, as we will discuss below.  The rule to remember, however, is that once the court has granted the eviction, i.e. awarded the landlord a ""judgment of restitution"" the <u>only</u> legal way for the home to be removed or resold is in accordance with the abandonment process described in ORS 90.675.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16349,column,und,MHCO Article: The Eviction Process And Judgments Of Restitution,"<p><strong><em>Do You Need an Attorney?</em></strong></p><br><p>Oregon, unlike our neighbor to the North, does not require landlords to obtain the use of an attorney to appear in FED court.  The necessary summons and complaint can be obtained from the courthouse and they can be filed and served quickly.  This has its advantages and disadvantages:  It is good insofar as it keeps the cost of the process down, but it is bad if the owner or manager fails to strictly follow all of the legal procedures required by the statutes.  Accordingly, for the inexperienced manager or new owner, it is strongly, recommended that guidance first be sought, either through the MHCO, from an experienced attorney, or by consulting with a knowledgeable community management company.</p><br><p><strong><em>Strict Compliance</em></strong></p><br><p>Since the FED process is designed to be a ""summary"" or quick proceeding, the law imposes upon those seeking its assistance, i.e. owners and managers, the duty to strictly comply with all of the requirements set out in the statutes.  This means, for instance, that the written notice that must precede the filing of the complaint (e.g the 72- hour nonpayment of rent notice or the 30-day notice of termination for cause) must be properly filled out <em>to the letter.</em>  Since the notice is required to be attached to the FED complaint, and thereby becomes a part of it, if the notice is defective in any respect, the Court can unilaterally dismiss it - thus forcing the landlord or manager to start all over again.  It is for this reason that before actually filing the summons and complaint which starts the FED court process, the plaintiff should closely review the notice to make sure it complies with the law.</p><br><p><strong><em>The First Appearance</em></strong></p><br><p>At the time the summons and complaint for eviction are filled out, a ""first appearance date"" will be inserted in the summon.  This date is the time for both landlord and tenant to appear before the court.  At that time, if the matter cannot be mediated or resolved, the tenant has to inform the judge whether he/she will either move out at a designated time, or request a trial to contest the eviction proceeding.  If the tenant wants to fight the eviction, the judge will usually require that they promptly file an answer setting forth their legal defenses, and set the matter for trial.  Experienced landlords and managers know full well that the first appearance is the time that many, if not most, evictions are settled.   If the default is nonpayment of rent, the landlord and tenant can simply enter into a stipulated payment arrangement providing that if it is not followed by the tenant, the landlord may come back to court and upon filing of the necessary papers, have the judge issue the judgment of restitution.  It is imperative that the landlord or his/her representative appear at the first appearance.  The failure to do so will result in an automatic dismissal of the eviction, and the landlord will have to start all over. </p><br><p><strong><em>The Judgment of Restitution </em></strong></p><br><p>As noted above, the judgment of restitution is the equivalent of the court's order in favor of the landlord's complaint for eviction, and requires that the tenant vacate the premises - which in a manufactured housing community, is the space upon which the home is situated.  In most cases, the court will insert a date in the judgment of restitution that will give the tenant a reasonable time to remove their belongings.  Once that date has expired, however, the tenant has no further right to come upon the premises.  Under the abandonment statute, assuming that the tenant voluntarily vacates the space, after seven (7) days of the tenant's absence following the date of issuance of the judgment of restitution, to commence the abandonment procedure, which is legally initiated by issuance of the 45-day letter to the tenant and other parties required by law.  During this 45-day period (assuming there is no lienholder), the tenant may contact the landlord to make arrangements for removal of the home.  However, such removal is conditioned upon payment of all ""storage charges"" which cannot exceed the existing rents.  However, as discussed below, the landlord <u>may</u> <u>not</u> require the payment of accrued storage charges prior to removal of the home if the tenant was forced to vacate the space as a result of the landlord's executing upon the judgment of restitution.</p><br><p><strong><em>Execution Upon a Judgment of Restitution</em></strong></p><br><p>Sometimes the tenant may refuse to move, even when the court has given them a firm date to do so in the judgment of restitution.  In such cases, the landlord must go to the clerk of the court to obtain a notice of restitution giving the tenant four (4) days to move out.  The notice of restitution is mail and personally served (or attached to the front entrance) by the sheriff or a civil process server.  After execution of the four (4) day period, if the tenant has still not vacated, then the landlord must ask the sheriff to execute upon the judgment of restitution originally granted by the court at the conclusion of the eviction trial.  The means that the sheriff will go to the premises, remove the occupants and post a trespass notice on the home, advising the tenants that any further entry will result in arrest and prosecution.  Although the abandonment law does not require the landlord to wait seven more days before commencing an abandonment, it does prohibit the landlord from recouping any accrued storage charges, should the tenant elect to remove the home following receipt of the 45-day abandonment letter.  <u>It is for this reason that landlords should only seek execution upon the judgment of restitution when absolutely necessary - i.e. when the tenant simply refuses to voluntarily vacate following the court's issuance of a judgment of restitutio</u></p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> The only exception would be if, prior to the tenant's abandonment, the landlord and tenant entered into a written agreement whereby the tenant waived his/her rights under the abandonment statute.

However, certain things, when not done diligently, can cost park owners and operators money. Title issues may not seem like a ""sexy"" issue or concern, but title problems can impact park operations. While parks are not in the business of ""monitoring"" title, there are at least three scenarios as outlined below that can impede the park's business if neglected. First, it is important to follow through on the transferring of title of a mobile home sold by a resident or third party to the mobile home park or vice versa. Similarly, the park needs to ensure that title is properly perfected in any sales within the park from an existing resident to a new resident. Finally, with respect to recreational vehicles specifically, it can be actual to obtain title paperwork before allowing such a recreational vehicle to remain in the park for an extended period of time.</p><p>                 </p>",959,994,1580,16603,column,und,Mobile Homes and Recreational Vehicles: Title Issues,"<p> It is fairly common in litigation or disputes involving mobile home tenancies for title to a home to change hands, whether pursuant to a ""warehouse lien"" authorized by statute after an unlawful detainer (evictions) judgment is obtained against a defaulting tenant, or by reason of a settlement between the parties or a surrender of a home to the park by heirs of a deceased tenant. A park should always ensure that title is properly transferred from a current or former owner to the park pursuant to all applicable laws (e.g., Department of Housing and Community Development requirements in California). Failing to do so runs the risk of problems occurring later. For example, if the park places a new tenant in the newly purchased home, thinking that the park owns the unit but later finds out that it does not have title to the unit significant legal issues can arise. For example, would the park have authority or standing to evict without title? In a scenario where a home has not been transferred properly the park can ordinarily obtain good title by way of an Abandonment Petition (in California at least) if the home is unoccupied. However, by placing a tenant in a recently purchased home, the park could be denied this avenue of transferring title and may have to pay to relocate the new resident. In addition, there is no guarantee that the tenant will cooperate. At the very least a tenant will be very unhappy. Following through and making sure that the park has proper title can save this and other unforeseen headaches. Indeed, as just noted, an eviction might be impaired without proper title documents.</p><p>                  Mobile home residents are often unaware (or uncaring) of the legal problems they can cause a park owner by selling their mobile home without notifying or getting the approval of the park (as most parks require). Such individuals are also likely to fail to transfer title properly. When the new owner defaults on payment of the rent, the failure to transfer title properly can cause an eviction nightmare for the park. One example is having an individual, whose identity is wholly unknown to the park, insert himself or herself as a defendant in an unlawful detainer or (eviction) case even after the case is essentially completed and lockout is scheduled. This individual can claim that he or she is the owner of the mobile home (though not on title) and that park management knew or should have known that he or she was living there and that he or she should have been served with the notice to pay rent or quit. This happens notwithstanding that all legal documents were served on the unit itself, some addressed to ""all occupants."" If a judge allows this new ""stranger"" into the eviction lawsuit, further legal fees will be expended to resolve the situation.                  </p><p>                  Many parks have recreational vehicles (and other ""motor vehicles"" including boats and dune buggies) in addition to mobile homes, either as residences, for short term stays, or for long term storage. Parks should require and obtain all title and registration information before such vehicles are allowed to stay in the park. Some of these vehicles, for one reason or another, will be abandoned in the park. The law usually does not allow the park to simply discard these vehicles when they are thought to be abandoned. Obtaining court authority or other legal authority to discard or sell abandoned vehicles usually requires pieces of information about them such as the make, model, vehicle identification number and registered owner that are not readily apparent by physical inspection. Getting this kind of information up front can save all sorts of time and expense down the line, including trips to the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain information. The sooner the park can rid itself of abandoned vehicles, the sooner the park can get back to the business of renting that space in exchange for rent.</p><p>                  The above situations illustrate just a few of the benefits of paying attention to the issue of title and registration. Park owners may not want to be in the business of concerning themselves with title to personal property within the park, but paying attention to title issues can save the park considerable time (and legal fees) in the future. </p><p><em>Bill Dahlin is a partner with the Southern California law firm of Hart King and a leader in the firm's Manufactured Housing Industry Practice Group.

The Most Important Oregon Statutes Affecting Park Owners Right Now!,"<p>Still, not everyone has gotten the message.  I've personally seen many owners - and real estate brokers! - list parks for sale without giving proper notice to residents, and I know of at least one lawsuit filed by residents against an owner for allegedly failing to comply. </p><br><p>Unfortunately, in addition to exposing owners to more potential liability, this law complicates the park sale process and can easily add an additional month before an owner can legally accept an offer. </p><br><p>This is important stuff!  Get online and look up ORS 90.842, 90.844, 90.846, 90.848, and 90.850.  Yes, it's a mind-numbingly boring read, but familiarity with it may save you from being sued.</p><br><p>Below, I've written a summary of the <u>basics</u> you'll need to know.  For brevity, I've left out some details and exemptions, and added my own abbreviations. </p><br><p>THE GUTS OF THE LAW:</p><br><p>An owner (""O"") must give written notice of intent to sell the park to Tenants (""T"") before marketing the park, <strong><em>or</em></strong> when _ receives an unsolicited offer to purchase that they intend to consider - whichever occurs first.</p><ul>	<li>The notice must be given to all T's of the park, or to a tenant's committee (""TC"") if one exists.</li>	<li><strong>The notice must include the following:</strong>	<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">		<li>The _ is considering selling the park.</li>		<li>The T's have an opportunity (through a TC) to compete to purchase the park.</li>		<li>Within 10 days of delivery of notice <strong><em>(An attorney would likely recommend first class mail with a certificate of mailing; and adding 3 days for mail delivery)</em></strong>, T's must form or identify a TC, and notify _ in writing of T's interest in competing to purchase the park, and give the name and contact info of the representative of the TC.</li>		<li>The TC representative may request financial information from the owner within the 10-day period <strong><em>(which the _ must provide within 7 days of delivery of the request).</em></strong></li>		<li>Information about purchasing a manufactured dwelling park is available from the Office of Manufactured Dwelling Park Community Relations of the Housing and Community Services Department.  <strong><em>(O must also send a copy of the notice to this same office!)</em></strong></li>	</ol>	</li></ul><br><p>THEN:  Within 15 days after delivery of the O's financial information (or within 15 days after the 10-day period if TC does not request financials), if the T's want to continue competing to purchase the park, the TC must form a corporate entity and submit a written offer to purchase the park to the O.  The _ may accept, reject, or submit a counteroffer, as they would with any typical market transaction.</p><br><p>THAT'S IT!  Simple, right?  NOPE.  I just boiled down almost 2,000 words of state statute into a tenth of that; and <u>I left out a bunch of important details</u>.  But as a park owner and licensed real estate broker, here's my basic takeaway: </p><br><ul>	<li>If you want to sell your park or have received an offer to purchase, give your tenants the proper notice -  <u>and don't formally accept another offer until you've worked through the process!</u>  There are several ways to accomplish that.  You can still seek or negotiate with other potential purchasers during this process, after you've sent the initial notice.</li>	<li>I recommend delivering notice to all tenants.  I believe that even if you have a solid tenant's committee in place at your park, there's still exposure to liability if not every single tenant knows about the opportunity to compete to purchase.</li>	<li>If you are purchasing an Oregon park:  make sure that before closing, the seller supplies an affidavit of compliance to you, your attorney, or the title insurance company, per ORS 90.850.</li>	<li><strong><u>There are some important exemptions from this requirement to give notice of sale - see 90.848.</u></strong>  The most applicable is section (i): ""Any sale or transfer in which the park satisfies the purchaser's requirement to make a like-kind exchange under section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.""  I've asked John VanLandingham, the tenant's attorney who drafted these laws, ""What if the purchaser is a group of partners wherein only one partner is completing a 1031 exchange?""  He assured me he believes the exemption would still apply.</li>	<li>I recommend to all my selling clients:  Forget the exemptions, err on the side of caution, and give the notice to all tenants, even if you believe your sale or transfer is exempted from the burden.  The statutes are written with too much unintended ambiguity, and people are too prone to filing lawsuits if they feel slighted. </li></ul><br><p><u><em><strong>MHCO will soon have a ""Notice of Sale of Manufactured Dwelling Park"" form available to use in compliance with these laws</strong></em></u>  - but you still must carefully follow the statutes, mind those deadlines, and be aware of the overall process!  I am not an attorney, and recommend your attorney review <u>all</u> tenant notices. </p><br><p>Good Luck!</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1528,23,1,1468278756,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12910,"<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a resident with a ""Social Anxiety Disorder.""

He has given us a deadline to respond.

If a person(s) disability is obvious, or otherwise known to the landlord, and if the need for the requested accommodation is readily apparent or known, then the landlord may <u>not</u> seek any additional information about the requestor's disability or the disability-related need for the accommodation. This law also applies to the use of assistance animals. </p><p>A ""reasonable accommodation"" is a reasonable change, exception or adjustment to a rule, policy practice or service that will enable a handicapped person to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the rented facilities and common areas. There must be an identifiable relationship between the requested accommodation and the person's disability.  Landlords are not required to make requested accommodations if doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden upon them or fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord's operations.  With respect to a person, a ""handicap"" means: (a) one with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; (b) one with a record of such impairment; or (c) one who is regarded as having such an impairment.  [Juvenile offenders, sex offenders, persons who illegally use controlled substances and those with a disability whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to others, or result in substantial physical damage to the property of others, are generally not protected under the Act.]</p><p>If a landlord refuses a requested accommodation, the requestor is encouraged to have a discussion with the landlord concerning an alternative accommodation. This is a summary only and not intended to constitute legal advice.  For more information, landlords, tenants and legal occupants of tenants are encouraged to consult with their attorney or a Fair Housing expert if they have any questions regarding their rights and responsibilities. </p><p>My first reaction is that what the resident is requesting is not appropriate for several reasons [and not simply because other residents do not have computers and cannot access Facebook]. Here is a sampling:</p><ul>	<li>He is asking for information that goes to business/management issues that may not be appropriate for sharing with residents, either because it is not available, it is subject to change, it may not be known, etc.  Even if it is appropriate for discussion at the general meetings, I can see this forum moving in the direction of demanding more and more information than management is willing to share. The test for content is, I suppose, whether it would be a topic of discussion at open meetings.</li>	<li>There should be one time and place for these meetings, and if you are not going to give up open meetings at scheduled times, then the Facebook approach is not only duplicative, but risks creating two lines of communication, one at the public meetings and the other over the Internet.  You should limit the meetings to the open forum.</li>	<li>Anonymity is a dangerous format for questions, since he could simply begin making up his own questions, turning the Facebook forum into an opportunity for his own private inquisition.</li>	<li>I don't think I would like to see my residents' questions spread across the Internet, for business reasons. Resident meetings are not open to the public, as far as I know.  Why would you do so with an Internet forum?</li>	<li>Clearly, what he wants is not what the other residents want - his request for the accommodation ignores their wishes and your needs as a manager. In other words, it is administratively impossible.</li>	<li>I'm sure with time I could come up with a host of other objections.</li></ul><p>You should, of course, take this request seriously.  While you want to briefly explain why you are unwilling to participate in this process, you don't want this to get into a lengthy dialogue on the matter. For example, what if you gave three reasons for declining his request? Then he files a Fair Housing claim, and you then give five reasons?  It appears that you just made up two new ones.  Accordingly, anything you say should be couched in ""Here are some - but not necessarily all - of the reasons I cannot grant your request.  The shorter the better.  No need to  get into a lengthy letter writing campaign.</p><p>You should definitely make a counter-proposal for the kind of accommodation you can grant - e.g. have someone take minutes of the open meetings (not recordings). He and everyone else can have the minutes for review.  If anyone wants to raise a question or comment about the minutes, they may do so at the following meeting.  He can select a proxy - i.e. another resident - to relay his questions and concerns at the meetings he does not want to attend.</p><p>Lastly, it appears that the rest of the residents want you present - his demand seems to want to subordinate everyone's needs to his.  That is not the concept behind a ""reasonable accommodation.""  It comes from the landlord to the requestor - not from the residents. Granting him what he wants/needs by taking minutes and allowing the proxy, reaches a far better balance for everyone involved. The residents have open meetings and he has access through the minutes and his proxy.</p>",839,1506,0,1502,1528,839,1,1415044777,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12911,"<p>A tenant's son has a conviction for sex abuse and is still on parole.

I fully suspect that there may be conditions of his parole that may apply to keep him out of the park.</p><p>At the risk of sounding harsh, it is a fact that ""sexual predators"" are not a protected class under the state and federal constitution.  In short, you can have rules forbidding them to be in the park due to the proximity of children. </p><p>If you don't have such rules, you may want to enact some. But even though you don', I believe you did the right thing to require that he not occupy the home.  You can and should do the same thing with regards to forbidding him to come into the park at all.  If his family wants to see him, they can go to where he currently lives.  The person(s) who has/have hired him to do odd jobs should be told that he cannot come into the park for ANY reason. </p><p>If you wonder whether this can be done without some specific rules, my response is that I would prefer rules to be in place.  But even though you presumably have nothing on point, it would not stop me from banning him from the park.  If he legally objects and wins, then it was a court that said he could come in - not you.  Your main duty is to the park residents and their children.  Better to try to remove him and fail than not to try at all. </p><p>Lastly, for your information,<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630""> ORS 90.630(1)(c)</a> permits a landlord to terminate a tenant if it is determined that they are ""a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587.""  From your question, I could not tell whether the adult son was on the rental agreement, but if so, he is a ""tenant.""  The statute is not clear whether it can be applied to only a single tenant, without terminating the tenancy of the remaining occupants.  Of course, the statute doesn'taddress the larger issue of whether you may prohibit him from coming into the park, but I believe you are fully within your rights, as discussed above.  However, you should first clear any such action with the park ownership, and they should secure legal advice on how to proceed.</p>",839,1506,0,1502,1528,839,1,1415044864,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13148,"<br><br><p>The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission has unanimously approved rules that beef up asbestos surveying requirements for owners of residential buildings or other persons proposing to demolish a residence in Oregon.

In simple terms, successful park operations depend on the people that your customers (park residents) interact with on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Taking the time to recruit personnel who are personable and help your operations run smoothly and efficiently is time-consuming. Effective and consistent recruiting take place both internally and externally. The watchword from industry experts is to ""be slow to hire and fast to fire"". That means take your time in interviewing and do background checks to be sure you have the person who will both enjoy the job and do the job properly. Mistakes in hiring are costly. Training takes time and money. If you've made a mistake, admit it and quickly terminate the relationship before it gets worse.</p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16599,column,und,Park Improvement Tips,"<p>Industry experts on the panel noted that <u>retaining</u> people who are effective with coworkers and the public is an ongoing process. Periodic employment reviews and training programs are generally well received. Most people want to know how well they are doing and what needs to improve. Coaching by regional managers and outside consultants is critical to recognizing employment and operational issues and correcting them before they cause other problems.</p><br><p>Second ""tip"" is also simple and can be summarized in one word: Documentation. It is critical that your community have well prepared written rental agreements whether for a long-term or month-to-month tenancy. There are, of course, pros and cons to both forms of tenancy. Certainly, in a rent control jurisdiction, long-term leases are preferred. However, it is well understood that obtaining an economically viable long-term lease can be difficult in rent controlled communities because of the legislative constraints on tenant negotiations. To the extent a local jurisdiction has vacancy control it is critical to pay attention to those opportunities to offer suitable long-term lease agreements so that future rent increases are known by both the resident and the park.</p><br><p>Another form of documentation to consider is arbitration agreements. There are intense debates among lawyers, and even within the industry, about whether or not arbitration is a desirable means of conflict resolution. If arbitration is going to be pursued, however, it is critical that the arbitration agreements reference and be drafted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act. While the State of California has an arbitration statute, it is effectively useless in compelling arbitration in most circumstances in a mobilehome park context. Numerous appellate State court decisions, when deciding whether or not arbitration can be compelled under the state arbitration law, are uniform in declining to enforce landlord/tenant arbitration agreements.</p><br><p>Documentation also means due consideration of park rules. Park rules are the functional equivalent of covenants, conditions and restrictions created for residential developments such as condominiums and planned unit developments. California law requires that park/community rules be reasonable and that, of course, is key to any judicial enforcement. Park owners differ as to whether they prefer general rules or more detailed rules. Again, there are pros and cons to each. However, when it comes to enforcement, it is this writer's experience that more particular detailed rules are typically easier to enforce than a more vaguely worded general rule where ""reasonable"" discretion by the park's resident manager might be seen by a judge as being less objective or personal. The courts in California tend to err on the side of tenants and thus making sure documentation (Rules) are objectively reasonable can greatly aid in their enforcement.</p><br><p>Tip three is getting to know your customer/market. Understanding who wants to live in your park and why it is important to properly serve that segment of the public and the larger ""neighborhood community"".</p><br><p>Consistent with knowing your market and customer, is knowing your competition. A park's competition might be other manufactured housing communities or, possibly, nearby apartment complexes, duplexes and triplexes in the area. Knowing who is renting and at what price is critical to knowing if your park is offering all that it can at a competitive price.</p><br><p>A fourth issue noted by regional park managers is the need to conduct a thorough park assessment. Many of the larger owners in the industry have an annual reassessment of each community including what potential capital expenses and improvements might be required. An annual or semiannual assessment can be done in conjunction with a documented risk assessment and analysis. Reviewing a community's streets, curbs, gutters and any recreational amenities can help a community be prepared for accidents; weather cause events and the ever present potential for litigation. A proactive system of having maintenance logs and keeping records of what has been repaired, when, and by whom is critical in the event of a simple slip and fall accident or, more significantly, if a ""failure to maintain"" lawsuit is threatened. In California failure to maintain allegations are routinely made against many communities that, from all objective criteria, are well-maintained and are highly desirable places to live.</p><br><p>Capital improvement and risk analysis assessments also lead to insight as to how a community is evolving. Is there a plan for replacing or improving the current housing stock? To the extent the park has the ability to help renovate or replace older functionally obsolete housing is a plan being considered. In some areas of California, the options of potential closure or conversion to a resident owned community are worthy of discussion. In rent controlled communities it might be prudent to have park owned homes so as realize appropriate revenue from the park.</p><br><p>One final tip: manage your revenue properly. Successful park operations need to follow and have a well-defined timeframe and process for rent collections. How rents are collected, managed and deposited is critical to cash flow. An annual review of the community to understand whether reserved parking or storage facilities should be provided, for a fee, should be considered. A number of communities have added solar panels to parking areas that generate revenue and help offset electricity costs in the park. Whether or not the park accepts electronic payments and how it processes resident checks can be critical to cash management. Knowing when and where funds are spent is ultimately the reason that the investment is either successful or not.</p><br><p>Thanks to Mindy Parish from Hometown America and Tom Pacelli from J&amp;H Management for their participation and insight as to how operations for community owners can be managed proactively and efficiently.</p><br><p align=""center"">Bill Dahlin is a partner with the Southern California law firm of Hart King and a leader in the firm's Manufactured Housing Industry Practice Group.

Community residents or prospective residents claiming a disability and desiring to keep a certain ""pet"" in contravention of a community's ""no pet"" or ""pet restrictive"" policy or rules will generally assert, however, that under either or both ADA or FHAA the community must alter its policy or rule to allow a pet as a reasonable accommodation. Evaluating whether an animal is truly a <em>pet </em>or qualifies as a <em>service or support animal requiring a reasonable accommodation </em>can be complex and confusing and should be undertaken seriously, methodically and objectively with the community's counsel. A wrong guess could be costly. Thus, in all cases where either ADA or FHAA may apply, to avoid possible ADA violations the ADA service animal test1 should be applied first. This is because if the animal qualifies under ADA as a <em>service animal </em>it must be permitted to accompany the disabled resident in all areas where persons are normally allowed to go. If the animal does not meet the ADA service animal test, community management must then evaluate a reasonable accommodation request under FHAA statutes and regulations.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16453,column,und,"Pets, Service and Comfort Animals--They're Different Under the Americans with Disability Act and Fair Housing Amendment Act? ","<p align=""center""><strong><u>ADA</u></strong></p><p>Under revised ADA regulations, a ""service animal"" is any dog individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. The work or task performed by the service animal has to be directly related to the handler's disability.2  The <em>service animal </em>fulfills what the regulations refer to as ""recognition and response"" tasks and is distinguish from animals that provide emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship. The key under ADA is that the animal must be specifically trained to ""recognize and respond"" a disabled person's certain mental or physical condition, e.g., a diabetic's dog may be trained to notice when the person's blood sugar reaches critical levels and alert the person.3 The ADA service animal test makes no reference to a dog's breed, size or weight, any required professional training or certification or registration or required wearing of a vest, patch or special harness. (Same under FHAA) The DOJ suggests that these are not factors in determining ADA compliance. A so called service animal <em>certification or registration documents </em>that can be obtained online confer no rights under ADA and are not recognized by the DOJ as proof that a dog is a ""service animal."" 4 On the other hand, DOJ notes that a service animal may be required under local law to be licensed and vaccinated.5</p><br><p>In determining whether an animal meets the ADA service animal test community management may make only two inquires of the disabled person: (1) Is this a service animal that is required because of a disability? and (2) What work or tasks has the animal been trained to perform? Management may not require documentation proving the animal has been ""certified,"" trained or licensed as a service animal. Further, these inquiries cannot be made if it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability (for example, an individual is using a dog to assist with vision, or the dog is pulling a person's wheel chair or is providing stability or balance for a person with an observable mobility disability). A ""no"" answer to no. 1 renders ADA inapplicable, likewise if the task described is <em>unrelated </em>to a disability or is a ""non-response"" type task. In such cases the answers may drift into areas which must then be assessed under FHAA regulations pertaining to reasonable accommodations for support or comfort animals, discussed below.</p><br><p>Can management ask a disabled person to remove an ADA qualified service animal from the community? No...  unless, the animal is out of control to the extent the handler is unable to control it or the animal is not house broken or based on an individualized assessment of animal's actual conduct the animal poses a direct threat to the health and safety of other residents that cannot be mitigated by other means.6 (Same under FHAA) Community rules or guidelines governing ""pet"" conduct therefore, should be written to apply to ""animals"" not simply ""pets"" which make it clear the community may enforce its rules or guidelines to remove a problematic service animal according to ADA standards.</p><br><p>Finally, ADA applies to places of <em>public accommodation. </em>Manufactured home communities and mobile home parks experiencing a HUD or DOJ ADA violation charge have contended that as private property not open to the public ADA is inapplicable. However, it's well established under the regulations and case law that an area within a mobile home community (usually office or clubhouse), apartment complex or condominiums where sales and leasing activities are conducted with members of the general public and areas such as parking lots or spaces that serve these areas are within the definition of a public accommodation subject to ADA. Does this mean the entire community is then a <em>public accommodation? </em>No.  However, U.S. District Courts in Arizona and California have held that allegations of a mobile home park hosting and conducting Bingo in the park clubhouse where the public was invited or where estate, garage or rummage sales were conducted in the community where the public was invited could state a claim under ADA that the community was a place of <em>public accommodation. </em>The take away... do not allow the general public to be invited</p><p>to attend events conducted in your community or risk becoming ""a place of public accommodation.""</p><p align=""center""><strong><u>FHAA</u></strong></p><p>FHAA prohibits discrimination in housing and housing related mattes based on a person's disability defined as: (1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, or (2) a record of having such impairment . . . . 7The FHAA's definition of prohibited discrimination encompasses ""a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling."" 8 This applies to assistance animals that may not satisfy the ADA definition of a ""service animal"" but nevertheless provide emotional support, comfort, well-being or companionship for a disabled person seeking an exception to a community's ""no pet"" or ""restrictive pet"" rules or guidelines.</p><br><p>Generally, an ""assistance or emotional support animal"" is a ""companion animal"" that provides a <em>therapeutic benefit </em>by alleviating or mitigating some symptom caused by an individual's mental or psychiatric disability as confirmed by a professional health care provider. Unlike ADA, these animals require no specific ""recognition and response"" training and management may ask the person for documentation of a disability and disability related need for the assistance animal, but may not request access to medical records or medical providers or to provide detailed or extensive information or documentation of the persons physical or mental impairments. These animals are not limited to dogs but may be any other animal within reason if the person requesting the accommodation has a confirmed disability supported by a medical professional.9</p><br><p>Thus, prohibited conduct under FHAA is refusing to make <em>reasonable accommodations </em>in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A request for a reasonable accommodation may be denied only if providing the accommodation is <em>unreasonable</em>, defined as imposing an undue financial and administrative burden on the community or if it would fundamentally alter the nature of the community's operations. This could include a denial based on increased liability insurance costs if an ""aggressive dog breed"" were allowed in the community thus potentially creating an <em>undue financial burden. </em></p><br><p>Requests for a reasonable accommodation regarding assistance animals must be evaluated objectively and thoroughly through an <em>interactive process </em>with the person requesting the accommodation. Each request should be evaluated on a ""case by case basis"" promptly and fairly, on its own facts. Naturally, if questions arise, consult the community's counsel, especially regarding state law that may parallel ADA and FHAA or be more expansive in coverage regarding definitions of service and assistance animals. The above is not intended as legal advice but offered as general information. Consult your legal counsel for specific questions or issues regarding your particular communities.</p><p><strong><span style=""font-size:14px;""><em>Robert G.

The HUD Memo does not address this issue ‰ÛÒ so we don‰Ûªt know what the feds would say. Accordingly, it may be prudent to take a more balanced approach in these situations. For example, rather than having a blanket policy that a tenant will automatically be rejected if their charge is still pending, landlords and managers should evaluate the matter based upon (a) When the matter will be resolved, e.g. a week, a month, or a year? (b) What was the charge? (c) If convicted, would the applicant automatically be denied?  As noted above, the whole issue of criminal background information is an element of the application process that need not be fully vetted, if, regardless of the crime, its severity or recency, the person would fail the application process <i>on other grounds.</i> If so, there is no need to rely upon the community‰Ûªs criminal background policy to vet an applicant. However, a word of caution here: Be prudent when selecting a basis for denial. Using a weak reason, versus a stronger one, can be viewed as pretextual if the applicant is a member of a protected class. In other words, beware of using a credit basis for denial if it is ""iffy"" and exclude the criminal background basis. In these cases, landlords and managers should consult legal counsel; it may be best to use both bases. </li>		<li style=""margin: 0px; text-align: justify; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">c.    ORS 90.303 says that a landlord may consider a conviction for certain conduct, generally relating to threats of violence, drugs, sex, or property damage, which would indicate risks to fellow tenants or the landlord. However, the HUD Memo is broader and more subtle (i.e. it demands an evaluation beyond a one-size-fits-all rejection policy).

The underlying premise to remember in addressing all of these issues, is that if the resident leaves the community without properly disposing of their home, the landlord has no choice but to deal with it as an abandonment. </p><br><br></div>",963,997,1580,16462,column,und,Phil Querin Article - Elderly Residents Who Leave the Community,"<div><p>Obviously, if the elderly or infirm resident, or their family, sell the home before the resident transfers to an assisted care facility, the problem goes away.

But if - as is all too often the case - the intent is to either to simply ""walk away"" or not make any payments until the home is sold, then the landlord must evaluate his or her alternatives.</p><br><p><strong><em>When the Resident Leaves</em></strong>   Under these circumstances, assuming that the resident or their family did not contact the landlord in advance, and there is no way to find out where they have gone, the only alternative is to issue a 72-hour notice for nonpayment</p><p>of space rent.   If it is not paid, the FED must be filed, and if the resident does not show up, the court will grant a judgment of restitution.  After the lapse of 7 days following issuance of the judgment of restitution, the landlord may commence an abandonment, and proceed to auction as permitted by Oregon law. </p><br><p>It is precisely because the landlord's alternatives are so limited, that it is important to try to determine, in advance, what is going on with the tenant.  If they are sick or infirm, this means trying to contact a close relative or friend.  Are they planning on leaving?  Are they going into an assisted care facility?  Are they working with a social worker?  If so, what agency is it?  Having the answer to these questions make it much easier on the landlord and ultimately the elderly tenant, when the time comes for the tenant to relocate because of advanced age or health. </p><br><p><strong><em>When the Resident Acquires State Assistance</em></strong>   Where the resident obtains state assistance, and that agency acquires lien rights in the home as a result, the landlord still has the right to enforce payment of the rent.  Similar to the situation where the resident ""walks away"" if rent isn'tpaid, an eviction may be filed and abandonment commenced following 7 days after the court's issuance of a judgment of restitution.  As discussed below, while the state agency has certain rights during the abandonment process, they are not any different than other lienholders.  However, if the space rent is not paid, either by the tenant or the state agency, the landlord has the right to commence the eviction process, by first giving a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.</p><br><p><strong><em>Dealing with the Estate</em></strong>  Most estate attorneys and heirs, do not understand the statutory abandonment process.  In a nutshell, the estate has substantially the same rights to resell the home under a storage agreement as a lienholder, except that the resale period lasts for 90 days or close of probate, whichever is longer.   Unfortunately, in most cases where the resident has passed away, the attorney, if one has been retained, or the beneficiaries, if not, assume that they do not have to pay space rent until the home is sold.  This is patently incorrect.  If the estate does not return the signed storage agreement within 60 days following the issuance of the abandonment and storage agreement, the landlord may proceed to auction. </p><br><p>In those cases in which the state agency has a lien (e.g. the Oregon Department of Revenue where the personal property taxes are paid under the senior citizens' deferral program), they must be notified of the abandonment the same as any other lienholder.   However, in many instances, the state agency fails to file its lien with the Department of Motor Vehicles (""DMV""), which is the primary source for landlords to determine whether there are any liens filed against the home.  Unless the landlord has actual notice of the lien, the failure of the agency to record it with the DMV will likely prevent it from being notified of a pending abandonment.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p><br><br></div><br><p>Conversely, if a landlord is notified that the state agency providing assistance to the resident intends to claim a lien, then he or she should make sure to give them notice, once the resident has left the home (with no intent to return) and the abandonment process has been started.

An eviction (formally known as a ""forcible entry and detainer"" or ""FED"") is an expedited legal procedure designed to allow landlords to obtain possession of their property through the court system.</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16437,column,und,Phil Querin Article - Some Tips and Traps - The FED Eviction Process,"<p><strong><em>Do You Need an Attorney?</em></strong></p><br><p>Oregon, unlike our neighbor to the North, does not require landlords to obtain the use of an attorney to appear in FED court.  The necessary summons and complaint can be obtained from the courthouse and they can be filed and served quickly.  This has its advantages and disadvantages:  It is good insofar as it keeps the cost of the process down, but it is bad if the owner or manager fails to strictly follow all of the legal procedures required by the statutes.  Accordingly, for the inexperienced manager or new owner, it is strongly, recommended that guidance first be sought, either through MHCO, from an experienced attorney, or by consulting with a knowledgeable community management company.</p><br><p><strong><em>Strict Compliance</em></strong></p><br><p>Since the FED process is designed to be a ""summary"" or quick proceeding, the law imposes upon those seeking its assistance, i.e. owners and managers, the duty to strictly comply with all of the requirements set out in the statutes.  This means, for instance, that the written notice that must precede the filing of the complaint (e.g the 72- hour nonpayment of rent notice or the 30-day notice of termination for cause) must be properly filled out <em>to the letter.</em>  Since the notice is required to be attached to the FED complaint, and thereby becomes a part of it, if it is defective in any respect, the Court can unilaterally dismiss it - thus forcing the landlord or manager to start all over again.  It is for this reason that before actually filing the summons and complaint which starts the FED court process, the plaintiff should closely review the notice to make sure it complies with the law.</p><br><p><strong><em>The Prevailing Attorney Fees Trap</em></strong></p><br><p>To underscore the importance of making sure the notice is correct <em>before</em> filing in Court, consider this scenario: Your tenant is late in paying the rent.  You quickly fill out and mail a 72-hour notice, wait six days and then file in Court.  At the first appearance (discussed below) you learn that the tenant is represented by legal counsel who has filed an answer alleging that the notice is defective.  You are now faced with the prospect of having to go to an attorney to find out just exactly what is wrong with your notice.  To your dismay, you learn that you sent the notice out on the 7<sup>th</sup> of the month, rather than the 8<sup>th</sup>.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>   You were one day too early.  While this might seem to be a technical and unimportant mistake - the tenant still got five full days after the 7<sup>th</sup> of the month - it is not.  In legal parlance, the defect is ""jurisdictional,"" meaning that the Court has no alternative but to dismiss the case.  To make matters worse, since the tenant's attorney filed an answer in Court, the tenant is the ""prevailing party"" and you must pay his or her legal fees.</p><br><p><strong><em>Use of Current Legal Forms (MHCO has over 60 Forms Available to Members)</em></strong></p><br><p>Too many times landlords and managers fall into the trap of using outdated legal forms - or worse - they hand-draft their own notices.  This can be fatal in Court.  As noted above, the Courts enforce strict compliance with the statutes.  The use of a hand-drafted notice is fraught with pitfalls:  The number of days to correct the default might be incorrect, the statement of the default might be insufficient, or the description of the landlord's remedies might be overstated. </p><br><p>Equally dangerous is the use of old forms that have become outdated due to changes in the law.  Landlords and managers should always note the date appearing at the bottom of the form.  If the date of the form precedes the most recent legislative year (e.g. 1997, 1999, 2001, etc.) you should check with the forms provider (e.g. MHCO) to make sure that there have not been any changes to the form.</p><br><p>For example, the 30-day termination for cause notice used to state that if there was a repeat violation within 6 months from the date of expiration of the 30 days, the landlord could issue a non-curable 20-day notice of termination.  However, due to a change in the statute, the 6-month period is now measured from the date of issuance of the 30-day notice.  In other words, the time within which the landlord may evict for a repeat violation is now measured from a different (and earlier) time period than before.  Use of the old form today would incorrectly state the landlord's right to terminate, and arguably be defective.</p><br><p><strong><em>The First Appearance</em></strong></p><br><p>Experienced landlords and managers know full well that the first appearance is the time that many, if not most, FEDs are settled.  If the default is nonpayment of rent, the landlord and tenant can simply enter into a stipulated payment arrangement providing that if it is not followed by the tenant, the landlord may come back to court and upon filing of the necessary papers, have the judge issue the judgement of eviction.</p><br><p>Pursuant to statute, the first appearance must occur within approximately one to two weeks following the filing of the FED complaint and payment of fees.  It is imperative that the landlord or his representative appear at that time.  The failure to do so will result in an automatic dismissal.  Generally, the Court is more than willing to allow the parties to negotiate a resolution - such as a repayment of rent schedule - that will avoid setting the matter for trial. </p><br><p>Landlords and managers are encouraged to take the first appearance process seriously.  If the case can be resolved at this juncture, all parties should strive to do so.  If the landlord has a tenant that they fully intend to evict, i.e. no settlement can be structured because of the seriousness of the violation, the facts should be fully discussed with an attorney <em>before</em> the first appearance.  Once the case has gone beyond that point and the tenant has secured an attorney, it may be too late.  If there is a defect in the notice, for example, it is far better to settle the case early, or unilaterally dismiss it and start over, than to have the matter set for trial and take the risk that the tenant's attorney or the Court will spot the defective notice.</p><br><p><strong><em>Pick Your Shots</em></strong></p><br><p>As I have repeatedly emphasized, don't go into Court on a weak case.  If the tenant has any sort of network within the community, it is a certainty that at least three things will occur: (1) The tenant will try to have all of his friends and neighbors testify against the landlord; (2) if you lose the case, you can fully expect that some of the tenants who have followed the dispute will try to ""test"" the landlord's resolve to go back into Court on related issues, and (3) if you ever have to bring another action against the same tenant, he will argue that your claim is ""retaliatory,""- in other words, that you are selectively prosecuting him.</p><br><p>Always make sure that you have sufficiently ""papered"" your file.  In most cases, it is helpful to precede a 30-day notice with one or more correction notices or letters requesting voluntary compliance.  In this manner the Court will see that you have ""walked the extra mile"" with the tenant.  You do not want to be accused of acting precipitously without having given the tenant fair warning of the consequences of non-compliance.</p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p><br><p>As noted, the FED process can be daunting to the uninitiated.  Sometimes the best lesson is to lose in Court.  But the cost of losing is frequently more than financial - it can threaten the landlord's ability to effectively run the community.  If in doubt, the safest course of action is to first seek the assistance of those who have been there before you.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> You must wait seven full days from the date rent is due, before sending out the notice.

""Pick Your Shot"" </strong>Never pick a fight you don't think you can win.  And if you decide to fight, make sure you get in your best shot.  By this I mean the following:  (a) Just because a tenant has violated one of the park rules, don't think the first thing you must do is file a 30-day notice to terminate.  If you file the notice, you've got to stick with it.  If the tenant fails to make the correction within the 30-day period, you may have no choice but to file for eviction.  Most lawyers want to go to court in an eviction proceeding with a file showing that the landlord or manager has ""walked the extra mile"" in trying to work with the tenant.  Judges and juries can be naturally sympathetic to tenants.  It bodes better for landlords when the evidence suggests that the tenant was either ignoring the landlord, or intentionally trying to aggravate the situation by breaking the rules.  Landlords and managers should strive to have at least two - if not more - polite reminder notices sent to the tenant.  The reminder does not have to give the tenant 30 days to come into compliance.  If a week is reasonable, give a week.  If compliance doesn'toccur within that time, send a second reminder, giving another week.  If compliance occurs, but the violation reoccurs, give another reminder.  The more paper in the file, the better the landlord's chances of prevailing in court.  (b) Once you decide to file for eviction, make it your best shot.  For example, if the tenant has broken three of the rules, only select the most serious ones.  And if the violation is something that can be verified by photographs, take some.  Make sure that the photos accurately depict the conditions constituting the violation as of the date <u>immediately</u> preceding the date of the 30-day notice.  When the 30 days has expired, <u>immediately</u> take another set of pictures that prove the violation was not cured.  Never take the pictures on the 29<sup>th</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> days.  Take them on first day <u>after</u> expiration of the 30 days.  Also, if the matter does go to court and the violation still exists, take pictures <u>immediately</u> before trial.  (c) If the case is capable of being resolved prior to filing, or even prior to court, give it serious consideration.  For example, say the tenant cured the violation on the 35<sup>th</sup> day after receiving a 30-day notice - and has pictures to prove it.  It is doubtful that a judge will evict them, even if they were technically outside of the 30-day compliance period.  Consider dismissing the case if the tenant will pay the filing fees.</p><br><br><p><strong>2.</strong>      <strong>Draft All Default Notices Carefully</strong>  In the vernacular of lawyers, the notice is ""jurisdictional"" - that is, it is the basis upon which the court will or will not exercise jurisdiction by hearing the case.  If a 30-day notice is defective, say because it gave the tenant 29 days to comply instead of 30, the court <u>cannot</u> hear the merits of the case.  You could have the best case in the world, and would have won in court without question - but it will make no difference if the notice is defective.  The court has no alternative but to dismiss the complaint.  If the tenant was represented by an attorney who filed an answer or other legal document on behalf of the tenant, it is probable that you will have to pay his/her attorney fees.  Accordingly, if in doubt, have your attorney review the notice <u>before</u> it goes out... especially if the tenant is one that will likely refuse to comply and force you into court.</p><br><p><strong>3.      don't be Afraid to Dismiss  </strong>If the notice is obviously defective, there is a high likelihood that the other attorney will recognize it.  If so, consider dismissing the case as soon as possible.  It will serve no purpose - except to pad the other attorney's pocket book - by continuing the fight in court.  Sometimes it is better to simply start over.  Dismiss the case, send out a corrected notice, and if the tenant fails to comply, file another eviction.  Although Oregon law does not require that landlords use an attorney to file evictions, it is always a good idea in those cases in which you know the tenant is already represented, or will seek legal representation before trial.  In such cases, landlords should consider having their attorney at least review the background facts and notice <u>before</u> the eviction is filed.</p><br><p><strong>4.      Maintenance Violations</strong>  These are one of the most prevalent and difficult of tenant violations.  There are several reasons.  Frequently, the violation, say continually storing ""junk"" on the space in plain view from the street, is really a matter of degree.  For example, while a barbecue and picnic chairs, neatly covered, may not be a problem, if they are old wooden chairs, a dilapidated table, a broken down barbecue, and an old air conditioner, all covered with a torn canvass tarp held in place by firewood, it will pose a problem.  Unfortunately, it is frequently such cases that gets into court - the tenant arguing that the problem is not as bad as the landlord maintains.  Also, landlords must be careful about consistent treatment.  It makes little sense to go to court against one tenant with a poorly  maintained space, if there are a dozen others whose spaces are just as bad.  In such cases, where the landlord (or perhaps the predecessor landlord) has been lax in enforcing maintenance violations, it is wise to first send out a park-wide notice to all tenants that the maintenance rules will be enforced.  The notice should request that all tenants clean up their spaces, if necessary.  Give everyone 30, 45, or 60 days to comply, during which time the manager should work with the worst offenders.  Managers should take careful notes, documenting their efforts to secure compliance.</p><br><p><strong>5.  Select &amp; Keep Good Managers</strong>  Not only is this good for the landlord, but it is good for tenant relations, as well.  There are exceptions.  Some tenants will attempt to demonize even the best managers.  Unfortunately, the reverse can be equally true.  But generally, good managers will get along with their tenants.  This will go a long way in keeping peace in the park.  But being a good manager is not simply being liked by the tenants.  Good managers will enforce the rules in an even-handed and fair manner.  They will be cordial with tenants and always attempt to communicate a rules violation first with a visit or phone call.  Such efforts should always be documented for the file.  Evictions can be won or lost depending upon whether the managers are likeable.  My experience has been that when a dispute gets into court, the tenant, along with his/her witnesses, will attempt to place blame on the conduct of the manager.  For this reason, the history of any case that finds its way to court should be replete with documentation that the manager attempted to work with the tenant.  The judge and/or jury should be convinced that the eviction was a last resort, and that the manager did everything humanly possible to secure the tenant's compliance before the case was ever filed.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1496758633,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13368,"<br><br><p><strong><em>Introduction. </em></strong>This bill is an attempt to deal with issues that had arisen between residents in some Oregon communities and their landlord regarding the physical condition of their homes.

The major issue going forward is for managers and landlords to be able to recognize <em><u>when</u></em> to use Form No. 55 to address disrepair and deterioration conditions, versus Form No. 43C, which is appropriate for violations relating to maintenance and appearance of the space.</p><br>",963,997,1580,16468,column,und,Phil Querin Article and Analysis - New Laws on Disrepair & Deterioration - New MHCO Form 55,"<div><h1><em>Tip</em><em>: Although Form 55 is only for use when there is disrepair or deterioration to the <u>exterior</u> of the home itself, the definition of a manufactured dwelling in </em><a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.100""><em>ORS 90.100</em></a><em> includes ""an accessory building or structure,"" and that term includes sheds and carports and ""any portable, demountable or permanent structure"".

Remember, you cannot expect the tenant to be a mind reader - just because you know the nature of the problem and the appropriate repair, does not mean the tenant is on the same page. If there is <u>any</u> ambiguity in the notice, a court would likely rule in favor of the tenant. Why? Because the landlord/manager filled out the Notice and had the ability at that time to draft it with sufficient clarity. </em></p><p><strong><em>Service of the Notice</em></strong><strong>. </strong> Most landlords and managers are familiar with the various methods of effecting service of notices. However, if in doubt, check the statutes. They are contained at <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.155"">ORS 90.155</a> (Service or delivery of written notice) and <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.160"">ORS 90.160</a> (Calculation of notice periods).  You can never be too careful; a notice giving a single day less than legally required, can result in the case being thrown out.</p><p><strong><em>Statutory Definitions. </em></strong>The new ORS 90.632 defines ""disrepair"" and ""deterioration"", and for the most part, they are quoted in MHCO's new Form No. 55:</p><br><h1>""Disrepair"" means being in need of repair because a component is broken, collapsing, creating a safety hazard or generally in need of maintenance.  It also includes the need to correct a failure to conform to applicable building and housing codes at the time: (a) Of installation of the manufactured dwelling or floating home on the site, or (b) The improvements to the manufactured dwelling or floating home were made following installation on the site.</h1><h1> </h1><h1>""Deterioration"" includes, without limitation, such things as a collapsing or failing staircase or railing, one or more holes in a wall or roof, an inadequately supported window air conditioning unit, falling gutters, siding or skirting, or paint that is peeling or faded so as to threaten the useful life or integrity of the siding. Deterioration does <em><u>not</u></em> include aesthetic or cosmetic concerns.</h1><h1> </h1><h1><em>Trap:  </em><em>Note that the definition of ""deterioration"" refers to  '_</em><em>paint that is peeling or faded <u>so as to threaten the useful life or integrity of the siding</u>."" (Underscore added.)  Before requiring a tenant to paint their entire home, it might be prudent to confer with a qualified painter who, if necessary, would be prepared to testify that the poor condition of the paint would likely threaten the useful life or integrity of the siding (at least as to the affected  area). This could avoid arguments in the future about whether the entire home or structure actually needed to be repainted.  In any event, management should be careful when issuing Form 55 to make sure that: (a) It is not issued for minor repairs bordering on the cosmetic, and (b) Required repairs are not overly burdensome or broad. For example, if one side of the home is exposed to the weather and in need of repainting, there may be little reason to insist that the resident repaint the entire home.</em></h1><h1> </h1><h1><em>Necessary Repairs.  </em>As before, SB 277A requires that management specifically describe what repairs are required to correct the disrepair or deterioration. In the new Form 55 we have included instructions both to the Cause section of form, and also to the Necessary Repairs section. And don't forget to attach additional pages, documents or photos, if it might be helpful; the more illustrative examples of what is wrong with the home and what repairs are necessary, the less room there is to argue about it later.</h1><h1> </h1><h1><em>Right to Extension of Time.  </em>There are three circumstances in which a resident may request an extension of the 60-day compliance deadline. Note however, as discussed above, there is no right to any extension if the adverse condition would pose a risk of serious harm.</h1><h1>                                                                                              </h1><ul>	<li><u>A</u><u>dditional 60 days</u>. If the necessary repairs involve exterior painting, roof repair, concrete pouring or similar work, and the weather prevents that work during a substantial portion of the existing 60-day period to cure;</li>	<li><u>Additional 60 days</u>.  If the nature or extent of the correction work is such that it cannot reasonably be completed within the 60-day cure period due to the type and complexity of the work and the availability of necessary repair persons;</li>	<li><u>Additional 180 Days (Six Months)</u>. If the disrepair or deterioration existed for more than the preceding 12 months with the landlord's or manager's knowledge, <em><u>or</u></em> rent had been accepted over that time.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left: 22.3pt;""> </p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong><em>The law requires the tenant to make a written request for an extension of time if it is sought in a reasonable amount of time prior to the last day of the 60-day compliance period. There are two issues, however: (a) How long an extension is the tenant asking for - 30 days, 40, 50, or 60? (b) Obtaining an extension also extends the deadline for compliance.  An oral extension does not nail down the additional time in writing and may not identify the new deadline. Accordingly, landlords and managers should insist on a written request from their tenants <u>and</u> should consider putting in writing: (a) The amount of time granted; and, (b) The new deadline. That way there can be no confusion about the length of the extension and the outside date that compliance must be completed.</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong><em>Issue</em></strong><em>: Does SB277A contemplate that following the request for a 60-day extension, management may agree to less? Possibly, since new law provides that the need for the extra time must be due to certain conditions that prevent that work from occurring <u>during a substantial portion of the existing 60-day period</u>. If confronted with this situation, management should consult with legal counsel.</em></p><p><strong><em>Notice of Correction. </em></strong>If the tenant performs the necessary repairs before the end of the compliance date, or extended compliance date, they have the right to give the landlord/manager a written notice that the issues have been corrected. There is no fixed time for management's response as to whether the repairs have been satisfactorily and timely performed; it is sufficient if it is within a reasonable time following the tenant's written notice. However, if a tenant gives this notice to management at least 14 days prior to the end of the completion deadline, or extended deadline, their failure to promptly respond is a defense to a landlord's termination of tenancy.</p><p><strong><em>Sale of Home; Prospective Purchasers. </em></strong>Prior to enactment of SB 277A, Oregon law permitted a tenant to sell their home while the disrepair/deterioration notice was outstanding, permitting the landlord/manager to give a copy of it to the new perspective purchaser, and providing that the sale would <u>not</u> automatically extend the compliance period. Essentially, the new tenant stepped into the shoes of their seller, and became subject to the same notice and time periods.</p><br><p>The practical result of this protocol was that as between the tenant and the prospective purchaser, they could negotiate any price reductions for the necessary work, and the new rental agreement would contain a provision requiring that it be completed within the time prescribed in the original notice, or a permitted extension.  <em><u>That is no longer the case under the new law</u></em>.</p><br><p>SB 277A now provides that at the time of giving a prospective purchaser the application and other park documents, the landlord/manager must <em><u>also</u></em> give them the following:</p><br><ul>	<li>Copies of any outstanding notices of repair or deterioration issued under ORS 90.632;</li>	<li>A list of any disrepair or deterioration of the home;</li>	<li>A list of any failures to maintain the Space or to comply with any other provisions of the Rental/Lease Agreement, including aesthetic or cosmetic improvements; and</li>	<li>A statement that the landlord/manager may require a prospective purchaser to complete the repairs, maintenance and improvements described in the notices and lists provided.</li></ul><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong><em>Tip:</em></strong><em> Note that the new law combines not only ORS 90.632 notices relating to damage and deterioration of the home or structures, but <u>also</u> a list of failures to maintain the space and other defaults, including aesthetic or cosmetic improvements. This may or may not include 30-day curable notices under ORS 90.630 for failure to maintain the space. But in <u>both</u> cases (i.e. defaults relating to structures, and those relating to the space), the new tenant appears to get the six-month period to comply. </em></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><em>This represents and interesting shift in Oregon law, and possibly for the better. Many parks historically gave ""resale compliance notices"" to tenants who were placing their homes up for sale.

This appears to say that a new tenant who fails to complete the items addressed in the notices and lists within the first six months, will thereafter be subject to issuance of a curable 30-day or 60-day notice to complete the required repairs. Accordingly, this is how the new MHCO Form 55 will read.</p><br><p>What if the landlord had already given the seller a written notice under one of these two statutes, but the compliance period had not yet run at the time of sale? The new statute does not carry over the unused time to the new tenant/purchaser, since under the new law, they will have received essentially the same information upon application, and will now have six months to complete.</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Nonetheless, it is still a good idea to give a detailed 90.632 notice to a tenant <u>before</u> sale.

If one or more of the items that caused issuance of a 30-day or 60-day notice under ORS 90.630 or 90.632 recurs within 12 months after the date of issuance of that notice, the tenancy may be terminated upon at least 30 days' written notice specifying the violation(s) and the date of termination of tenancy. In such case, correction of the disrepair or deterioration will <u>not</u> prevent a termination of the tenancy.</p><br><ul>	<li>As under the prior law, a copy of the disrepair and deterioration notice may be given by the landlord/manager to any lienholder of the tenant's home.</li></ul><br><p>And darestillrequiredtopayrentuptothe</p><p style=""margin-left: 40.5pt;""> </p><ul>	<li><em>: If the rent tendered by the tenant covers days that extend beyond the deadline for compliance, or any permitted extension thereof, it should be returned to them within ten (10) days after receipt, pursuant to </em><a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.412""><em>ORS 90.412(3)</em></a><em>.

At the time, there were five main protected classes, i.e. groups of persons entitled to the protection of the Act. Those classifications were <em>race, color, religion, sex,</em> and <em>national origin</em>.

On June 25, 2015, the United States Supreme Court, in <a href=""http://bit.ly/1nSlIp5""><em>Texas Dept. of Housing vs. Inclusive Communities</em></a><em>,</em> ruled that under certain circumstances, disparate impact theory <em><u>can</u></em> provide the basis for liability in matters pertaining to the sale and rental of housing.</p><p> </p><p>The factual background of the case is as follows: In 2008, Inclusive Communities, a Dallas non-profit, sued the Texas Department of Housing, claiming that the state was awarding tax credits for the construction of affordable housing more frequently in minority neighborhoods than in Caucasian neighborhoods. They argued that this practice resulted in a higher concentration of low-income housing in minority neighborhoods, thus perpetuating <em>de facto</em> segregation in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p><p> </p><p>The lower federal district court had ruled in favor of Inclusive Communities and the Fifth Circuit agreed, requiring Texas to allocate the subsidies more evenly. The Texas Department of Housing appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that it was on the horns of a dilemma: On the one hand it was required <em>not</em> to discriminate based on race, and on the other, it was required to issue housing credits that disproportionally <em>[albeit unintentionally]</em> benefitted neighborhoods with large minority populations.</p><p> </p><p>Thus, so goes the argument, disparate impact theory has created a perverse incentive for businesses, lenders, and municipalities to subtly engage in a form of ""reverse discrimination"" i.e. benefiting certain protected classes, in order to avoid disparate impact claims. Ironically, in Inclusive Communities, that appears to be exactly what occurred, i.e. the state of Texas tilted in favor of the neighborhoods populated with minorities, rather than poor white communities, in order to avoid a claim of disparate impact against the minorities. But ironically, disparate impact theory can be a two-way street; in the Inclusive Communities case, Texas's efforts to <em>avoid </em>disparate impacts resulted in exactly what it sought to avoid.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em><u>The Majority Opinion</u></em></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>Justice Anthony M.

And mistakes in understanding the law frequently work <em>against</em> landlords.  The basic rule-of-thumb to remember is that the written document which defines the landlord-tenant relationship must be complete <u>and</u> must be followed.  While Oregon law does contain some restrictions upon what landlords can put into their rental agreements,<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> generally, they are far better off commencing the rental relationship with a strong, clear and fair written document.

The difference is that the month-to-month agreement runs for 30 days at a time.  In the absence of termination, the periodic tenancy just ""rolls over"" month to month.  Regardless of which agreement is used, landlords renting or leasing spaces to residents in mobile home parks may generally not terminate them without cause.  However, a lease for at least two years carries a distinct advantage in that the park documents, i.e. the lease agreement and the park rules, may be <em>automatically</em> updated at the end of each lease term.  While there are certain limitations upon the landlord's right to impose new park documents on the resident, it is clearly much easier to do under a lease than a monthly rental agreement. <a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>  Also, landlords using a</li></ol><p style=""margin-left: 0.75in;"">fixed term lease agreement must expressly incorporate any rent increase provisions into the written agreement.  The rent increase statute, ORS 90.600, applies <em>only</em> to periodic (e.g. month-to-month) tenancies and not fixed term tenancies.  If the home located upon the space is a recreational vehicle rather than a manufactured home, landlords should <em>not</em> use the standard mobile home space rental agreement.  The reason is that the mobile home park section of the landlord-tenant law does not apply to recreational vehicles.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>  When renting space for a recreational vehicle, landlords should use an appropriate RV rental form.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""2""><strong>Make sure that the rental agreement is signed by <em>all</em> adult tenants who will occupy the space.</strong>  This not only financially obligates them under the agreement, but it makes it easier to enforce violations against rules offenders.  Do not permit occupancy of a home until the rental agreement has been fully signed by everyone.  Trying to get signatures after-the-fact can be difficult, if not impossible.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3""><strong>Make sure that the Statement of Policy, Rules, and Rental Agreement are given to the resident and properly receipted for.</strong>  Occasionally, residents deny receiving one or more of these documents.  However, the signed receipt by the resident is legal evidence of delivery of these documents.  ORS 90.510(9) provides that a signed receipt is a defense to a claim against the landlord for nondelivery of these documents.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4""><strong>Similarly, landlords should make sure that the rights they summarize in the Statement of Policy accurately reflect their rental agreement and rules.</strong>  When using the MHCO forms this is not a problem.  It could be, however, when different forms from different sources are used, and the Statement of Policy provides that the resident has (or does not have) certain rights that are not consistent with those found in the rental agreement or rules. The Statement of Policy is not intended to be a binding legal document.  It is supposed to merely summarize the rights and duties of the resident which are found in the rental agreement or rules.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""5""><strong>Understand the rights given you under the rental agreement form.</strong>  Not knowing your rights can result in not enforcing violations, which can lead to a waiver of those rights.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""6""><strong>One of the more important provisions of the rental agreement form is the one which prohibits assignment, subletting or transfer of possession of the agreement or space without the landlord's prior written consent.</strong>  Landlords should make sure that when a resident vacates, leaving a guest or visitor at the space, immediate action is taken to either terminate the tenancy or require that the occupant promptly apply for tenancy by filling out all required documentation.  Do not accept rent from the occupant, the ex-tenant, or on the occupant's behalf, until the issue has been thoroughly resolved.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""7""><strong>Be aware that the fire insurance provision does <em>not</em> apply unless it is specifically checked:</strong>  It requires that the resident must maintain a homeowner's policy of insurance that includes coverage for fire in an amount sufficient to replace the home, and permits the landlord to request a current copy of the policy.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""8""><strong>Similarly, landlords should be sure to have the resident initial those portions of the rental agreement which require them to do so. </strong> There are several such places found in the sections dealing with (a) sale of the home and (b) the resident's legal obligations under the tenancy.  When these sections are not properly initialed, there remains an argument that it is not binding.  Although such an argument would not likely carry the day, it can be avoided entirely by simply making sure that when the agreement is signed, all internal provisions are properly completed, checked and initialed where appropriate.</li></ol><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""9""><strong>The landlord's rights upon a resident's resale are very important and need to be fully understood by both parties.</strong>  One such section of the resale portion of the rental agreement provides that in the event the resident (or their predecessors) has/have made any improvements or alterations to the interior or exterior of the home which did not conform to all applicable local, state and federal building codes or ordinances in existence at the time the work was performed, the landlord has the right to require, as a condition of consent to the sale, that such improvement or alteration be brought up to all applicable local, state and federal building and construction standards in existence at the time of the sale.  When homes have been substantially remodeled, especially where electrical or plumbing systems are involved, this provision may be useful for the landlord to enforce in order to make sure that the proper building codes are followed.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""10""><strong>Disputes are an inevitable part of being a landlord.</strong>  MHCO believes that assigning fault is less important that securing a workable resolution.  Landlords should be aware that Oregon law requires them to have a informal dispute resolution process in their rental agreement.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>   The MHCO form provides that in the event of any dispute regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the rental agreement or the rules and regulations, either party shall have the right to have the matter handled through the alternative dispute resolution (""ADR"") process set forth in the attached MHCO Addendum, which is incorporated into the agreement.

Then you can say to the resident that you will permit them to stay only on condition of payment of the outstanding court fees.  Obviously, this is a pretty big hammer and if they can't pay the fees all at once, you should negotiate partial payments, similar to what I suggested above.  However, this alternative would automatically not result in a ""Stipulated Judgment of Restitution"" (you would have to be in court to get that).

And occasionally, residents attempt to have a second pet, claiming that it isn'ta ""pet,"" but an assistance animal.  However, here is where the line blurs. How far does the landlord have to bend to accommodate residents, especially in those situations where the resident is gaming the system?</p><p>MHCO has forms for dealing with requests for reasonable accommodations, whether they be a non-compliant animal, or some other issue, such as an additional parking space, etc.  First and foremost, I suggest following the same protocols in all cases, from the legitimate to the illegitimate.</p><p>Secondly, I suggest following the 3-prong test (besides cost, which doesn'treally apply in most cases) as follows:  Would granting of the request endanger the Health, Safety, or Welfare of other residents or guest in the community.  If the resident, for example, asks to have a pit bull as an assistance animal, it is not altogether unreasonable, after vetting the dog's demeanor, socialization, etc., to propose another less aggressive animal as a ""reasonable accommodation."" </p><p>Third, for such breeds with known vicious propensities, you should check with your liability insurance carrier to see if they have a short list of animals they will not insure if there is an attack.  If the carrier says the animal is on that short list, then you should propose another less aggressive animal.</p><p>Then there are cases in which the request is clearly a ruse to get a pet approved as an assistance animal, when and it is clear to any reasonable person, it is a ruse.  You will have to decide on your own, or with the assistance of your attorney, how to proceed.  If, after giving the resident the MHCO form to complete, you are satisfied that it is a ruse, you are going to have to decide whether to call their bluff, or relent. If you relent, you will have done so only after requiring them to complete the necessary paperwork.

I'm sure the Storage Agreement adequately covered what was to occur upon sale.  But since we have a landlord now asking <em>what happens if the sale does not occur by November 30</em>, I'm led to believe the parties neglected to address (in writing) the possibility of failure.  <u><em><strong>Memo to MHCO landlords:  Written agreements with tenants should always address ""the exit strategy"" - i.e. what protocol kicks in if the home is not sold and not removed by November 30.</strong></em></u></span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Without addressing this issue in the written Storage Agreement, we are left to figure out what Oregon law would provide under these facts.  Here's my take:</span></p><ul>	<li><span style=""font-size:14px;"">On December 1, the landlord should contact the ex-tenant and demand that the home be removed.  This should be done in writing or e-mail, so it can be used later if necessary.</span></li>	<li><span style=""font-size:14px;"">If removal does not occur promptly, the landlord must rely upon Oregon law.  Unfortunately, the law leaves landlords holding the bag if a home is abandoned.  </span></li>	<li><span style=""font-size:14px;"">The landlord will have to determine if the tenant will voluntarily waive his abandonment rights, and if not, then he must follow the legal procedure under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.675"">ORS 90.675</a>.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> If there is a lienholder on the home, the landlord will have to give them notification under the abandonment law.</span></li>	<li><span style=""font-size:14px;"">If the landlord wants to leave the home on the site and resell it to a new tenant, that option is always available<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>, and probably should be pursued first, rather than going down the abandonment route, which can be costly in time and money.  Care should be exercised to properly document such an arrangement, in order to avoid later complaints by the tenant that they were taken advantage of.  </span></li></ul><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">In Oregon, following the formal abandonment process is the only legal way for a landlord to take control of a manufactured home if the tenant fails or refuses to remove it upon termination of the tenancy.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">    </span></p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> The question about a one-year rule, relates only to the closure of a park or park space, and will not be addressed here.</span></p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> This may mean that the landlord will have to go through the exercise of issuing a 72-hour notice, then going to court to get a judgment of restitution.

If the resident cannot afford the expense, you will have to work something out (e.g. cost sharing, or you remove them and seek reimbursement), since you cannot afford to allow this dangerous situation to continue, as it might endanger other residents.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:12px;""><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">ORS 90.740(4)(i) </a>provides that it is the resident's responsibility to: ""Maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches and leaves, on the rented space for a manufactured dwelling except for hazard trees as provided in ORS 90.727.""  Thus, the resident's failure to do so in this case would constitute a basis for your issuance of a 30-day curable notice of termination under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630(1)</a>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:12px;"">If the resident declines to do the removal, and decides to move from the community, you will have to make sure that the buyer of the home is aware of the removal responsibility. You could write that into the new rental agreement.  (If you do not make it a condition of the rental agreement, and they are ""hazard trees,"" the new resident will not had a duty to remove - you will at your cost.) My guess is that with your advance notice to the prospective purchaser, the cost of removal would be deducted from the sales price.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:12px;"">As for your insurance agent's <em>less than sage</em> advice, I respectfully disagree.  If a dangerous condition exists on a space in the community and it is not remedied, even though it is the tenant's primary responsibility, you will be held liable if you permit it to continue. It may be an ""Act of God"" in your agent's mind, but it is a foreseeable risk waiting to happen in the eyes of the law.  (Henceforth, I promise not to give advice on insurance coverage, if your agent promises to refrain from practicing law.)</span></p><div><hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><span style=""font-size:12px;""><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> ""Diameter at breast height"" i.e. 4.5 feet.

How can owners and managers take control of the issue?</p><br><p>First, landlords should check their current rules and rental agreement. Although landlords who have previously permitted pets in the community, cannot retroactively prohibit them to tenants who already have pets living with them.  Nor can they retroactively prohibit a type of pet that had previously been permitted.  However, going forward, i.e. for new tenants, landlords should make sure that their rules place appropriate limitations on the size and type of pets that can be brought into the park.  Rules should be drafted broadly to prohibit pets, e.g. breeds of dogs, that  have a reputation for aggressiveness, or dogs of a particular size, or both.</p><br><p>Secondly, consistency is important.  That is, landlords should be careful not to make exceptions or ignore violations of the pet rules.  Otherwise, the landlord will be accused of either being arbitrary or ""playing favorites.""  Selective prosecution of tenants for violation of the pet rules does not play well with judges and juries. </p><br><p>Lastly, in all cases, landlords should make sure that their tenants sign pet agreements for their animals.  Oregon law expressly permits this.  The MHCO agreement follows the statutory guidelines and assures that the tenant has liability insurance coverage.  It also permits landlords to  assess fines for violations of the rules. </p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16400,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - A Potpourri of Topics - Tips and Traps,"<p><strong><em>Evictions.  </em></strong></p><br><p>Most evictions are either for failure to pay rent or violation of rules.  An eviction (formally known as a ""forcible entry and detainer"" or ""FED"") is an expedited legal procedure designed to allow landlords to obtain possession of their property through the court system.  Oregon does not require that landlords obtain an attorney in order to file an FED.  The necessary summons and complaint can be obtained from the courthouse and they can be filed and served quickly.  This has its advantages and disadvantages: It is good insofar as it keeps the cost of the process down, but it is bad if the owner or manager fails to strictly follow all of the legal procedures required by the statutes.  Accordingly, for the inexperienced manager or new owner, it is strongly, recommended that guidance first be sought, either through the MHCO, from an experienced attorney, or by consulting with a knowledgeable community management company.</p><br><p>Since the FED process is designed to be a ""summary"" or quick proceeding, the law imposes upon those seeking its assistance, i.e. owners and managers, the duty to strictly comply with all of the requirements set out in the statutes.  This means, for instance, that the written notice that must precede the filing of the complaint (e.g the 72-hour nonpayment of rent notice or the 30-day notice of termination for cause) must be properly filled out to the letter.  Since the notice is required to be attached to the FED complaint, and thereby becomes a part of it, if it is defective in any respect, the Court can unilaterally dismiss it - thus forcing the landlord or manager to start all over again.  It is for this reason that before actually filing the summons and complaint which starts the FED court process, the plaintiff should closely review the notice to make sure it complies with the law.</p><br><p><strong><em>Leases &amp; Rental Agreements.</em></strong></p><br><p>As a result of  MHCO's efforts in the recent Legislative Session, landlords will be able to use leases for two year terms or more.  At the end of the term, the tenant must either agree to a new updated lease as well as rules and regulations. Briefly, the process is as follows: Not more than 60 days prior to the termination of the lease, the landlord must provide the tenant with a copy of the new proposed lease and rules.  Thereafter, the tenant has 30 days within which to either agree to the new terms or to vacate and remove the home.  If the tenant declines to sign and elects to vacate, he/she can try to re-sell the home in the park for up to 12 months, so long as storage fees are paid. </p><br><p>The one limitation on landlords - and not an unreasonable one - is that the new lease agreement or rules that the tenant may be asked to sign must be the substantially the same as those the landlord is currently offering others who are seeking to rent a space in the community.  </p><br><p>One <em>caveat</em> for landlords:  If they fail to offer the new rules and lease agreement to the tenant on or before 60 days prior to expiration of the current term, the lease turns into a month-to-month tenancy. </p><br><p>Thus, the use of leases under the new law will now permit landlords to unilaterally update their rental agreements and rules.  We'll be talking about this in depth at the Annual Convention.</p><br><p><strong><em>Day Care Facilities.</em></strong></p><br><p>Frequently, community managers are confronted with tenants who seek to open day care businesses in their home.  There are multiple issues involved here.  First, is it a violation of the existing zoning laws to use the home for a commercial business?  Secondly, will it impact the landlord's insurance rates?  Lastly, what about increased traffic and risk of accidents?  All of these issues militate <u>against</u> permitting tenants to open such enterprises. </p><br><p>Landlords should review their rules and regulations to make sure they have adequate limitations on day care businesses.  If they do not, consideration should be given to updating the rules to make the appropriate amendments.  However, for those landlords or managers whose rules do not address the issue, how is one to proceed?  Oregon law provides that violation of the law constitutes a breach for which a curable 30-day notice of termination may be given. Accordingly, the landlord or manager should first check the zoning law.  If it is a residential neighborhood, there may be zoning restrictions on such business enterprises.  Also, even if there is not current restriction, there is nothing illegal about instituting a restriction of day care facilities immediately.  Oregon law permits such rules, even if they make a material modification to the landlord-tenant relationship, so long as they are passed by the tenants in a legally adopted rule change (i.e. 51% or more do not object.)</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1490370170,1534198260,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13078,"<p><strong>Question:  </strong>When can a manager refuse payment by check? If the name on the check does not match the resident's name can (or should) the check be refused?  Should there be a park rule to back this up?

All of this stems from the concern of unauthorized residents becoming tenants simply because a manager accepts a check for space rent when they are not an approved tenant.<br /> </p><br>",963,997,1580,16178,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Accepting Rent When Another Name is On the Check,"<p><strong>Answer:  </strong>One issue is accepting rent from a possessor after the legal tenant has gone. This can occur, for example, where someone is residing at the space under a Temporary Occupancy Agreement, but the approved tenant, no longer resides there. Alternatively, the person could be a lawful visitor, who has overstayed their permitted time, and the legal resident has left. <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.403"">ORS 90.403</a> deals with this:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong> 90.403 Taking possession of premises from unauthorized possessor.</strong> (1) If an unauthorized person is in possession of the premises, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the cause and the date and time by which the person must vacate, a landlord may take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 if:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (a) The tenant has vacated the premises;</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (b) The rental agreement with the tenant prohibited subleasing or allowing another person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the landlord; and</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (c) <em><u>The landlord has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession of the premises</u></em>.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (2) Service of notice under this section does not create a right of tenancy for the person in possession of the premises. [2005 c.391 _12] (Emphasis added.)</p><br><p>In this case, it can be fatal to a landlord's effort to remove that person if rent is accepted. If rent is in the form of a check, cash or money order, I can think of no reason to accept it. Period.  Since the person is an unlawful occupant, I'm not concerned that there is no rule on it, since the statute clearly gives you the legal entitlement to evict.</p><br><p>The other issue arises when a lawful resident resides in the space, but they have an occupant who has not been approved as a co-tenant or a temporary occupant.  If you are going to accept them as a temporary occupancy, get them on a Temporary Occupancy Agreement. You can do a criminal background check, but not a financial one, since they are there not to subsidize the tenant's rent, as in co-tenancy.  Accordingly, do not accept rent in any form from temporary occupant, unless it is drawn on the tenant's sole account and the check bears that out. </p><br><p>As to unlawful occupants who are staying at the space, but have not been approved as a tenant, the issue of the form of payment misses the larger point - which is waiver. If the person is unauthorized, and you know of their occupancy, insist that they apply for tenancy, and make sure they do not stay beyond the time allowed for visitors under the park rules.  The issue of waiver is not just a question of accepting a check from the unapproved person.  Acceptance of rent from the lawful tenant when you know he or she is housing an unapproved person, can also result in waiver.</p><br><p><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.412"">ORS 90.412</a> provides in part:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(a)</strong><em><u>During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant</u></em>; <strong>or</strong></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(b)</strong>Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(3)</strong>A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(a)</strong>Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent; <strong>or</strong></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(b)</strong>The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. (Emphasis added)</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><p>So the take-away here is that you do not want to accept rent from anyone, even the tenant, when you know they are violating the rules, such as keeping an unapproved occupant at the space. If you accept rent from the lawful tenant under these circumstances, return it within ten days after receipt - if the check has been cashed, write a new check back to the tenant with an explanation, and demand that the unpermitted person apply for tenancy. Under the statute, waiver will not occur for the first two events of accepting the rent without returning is within ten days. The third or subsequent time can constitute a waiver. Waiver does not occur if the rent is properly returned within the ten day period, no matter the number of times it's tendered.</p><br><p>As for taking a rent check from the unapproved person, I don't recommend doing so unless the check is drawn on the tenant's own account. If it's a joint account with the unapproved person, don't accept it. The same holds true of any other form of payment (e.g. cash or money order) unless there is clear evidence that it came from the lawful tenant. Just remember, though, that acceptance of rent from the lawful tenant - in any form - can count as a waiver under ORS 90.412 if you know they have an unlawful occupant at the space. </p><br><p>As for a park rule, I think it's always a good idea to have a rule about the time, place and form of payment. It's OK to say non-residents cannot pay the space rent for residents, but even without such a rule, I believe you are within your rights to refuse payment. Rent is defined at <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.100"">ORS 90.100(37) </a>as follows:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Rent means any payment to be made to the landlord <em><u>under the rental agreement, periodic or otherwise, in exchange for the right of a tenant and any permitted pet to occupy a dwelling unit</u></em> to the exclusion of others and to use the premises. (Emphasis added.)</p><p>Since the payment from the unauthorized resident is not from a ""tenant"", and not pursuant to the ""rental agreement"", and not ""in exchange for the right to occupy"" the space, it's my opinion that, with or without a rule to this effect, you are within your rights to reject it, regardless of form.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1447257156,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13420,"<br><p><strong><em>Question No. 1. </em></strong> </a>Our community recently had a rule that permitted street parking from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM). The rule was changed and now prohibits any street parking at any time.  The reason for the new rule was due to the narrowness of the streets which prevented emergency vehicles clear access.  The rule change passed with no objections. Since the adoption of the new rule we have had a handful of residents and their guests who refuse to follow the new policy and a few residents who have hinted that they need a reasonable accommodation. </p><p>The first reasonable accommodation request is from a resident who says it ""inconvenient"" for herself and her caretaker(s) to shuffle cars in the driveway.  The driveway accommodates two vehicles.  The resident has one car and the caretakers and they must park end-to-end.  Since the caretakers alternate shifts, there are only two vehicles in the driveway at the same time. </p><p>One caretakers seems to abide by the rules but the other will not.  The caretaker who refuses to follow the rule says she is handicapped and has a handicap parking permit. She says we <em><u>must</u></em> allow her to park on the street.

There must be an identifiable relationship between the requested accommodation and the person's disability.  Landlords are not required to make requested accommodations if doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden upon them or fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord's operations. In order to address the request, Landlords are entitled to obtain information that is necessary to evaluate it for a reasonable accommodation.  With respect to a person, a ""handicap"" means: (a) one with a physical or mental impairment which <em><u>substantially limits</u></em> one or more major life activities; (b) one with a record of such impairment; or (c) one who is regarded as having such an impairment.  Juvenile offenders, sex offenders, persons who illegally use controlled substances and those with a disability whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to others, or result in substantial physical damage to the property of others, are generally not protected under the Act. If the landlord refuses a requested accommodation, the requester is encouraged to have a discussion with the landlord concerning an alternative accommodation.

The more cars you permit to park on the street, the more others will try the same thing.

However, that is because it is limited to situations where a prospective tenant is seeking entry into the park as a tenant. There is nothing in Chapter 90 dealing with background check for guests who will remain at the park in excess of 14 days.  However, if I were to draft a rule to implement your suggested policy, I would likely use it as a general template of issues that should be addressed, since some of them are the same, e.g. denial of the right to remain at the premises because of a failure to pass the background check. Additionally, you would want to make the list of disqualifying criteria known in advance, so tenants and applicants knew whether it would be worth the cost and effort to apply.</p><br><p>Lastly, I suggest that you implement such a rule through a rule change in accordance with <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.610"">ORS 90.610</a>.

Her sister arrived from California at the park and is staying at the stricken resident's house. The sister has a 5-year old daughter. The park is a 55+ community. The resident is completely incapacitated. Some residents are upset that a 5-year old is staying in the community. What is management's responsibility regarding the sister and daughter's access to our resident's house? A temporary occupant agreement requires the signature of the resident, who, in this case, is not available. And the landlord is not even sure if the sister has permission from the resident. Finally, what about the 5 year old? What should be the landlord's course of action?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16275,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Child in 55 & Older Community - Resident in Hospital,"<p><strong>Answer.  </strong>Before addressing your question directly, it is important to understand what state and federal law say about 55+ communities.  Besides several qualifying requirements, a legally established 55+ community must have <em>at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. </em></p><br><p>This 80/20 rule is critical. Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that the 20% margin <em><u>must</u></em> be reserved for families with children?  The answer is ""No.""  In fact, a 55+ community may strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age or older?  Again, the answer is ""No.""</p><br><p>If desired, a community may increase the age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.  Similarly, a community may impose a more restrictive minimum age requirement than 55.  In order to maintain this exemption from the Fair Housing laws which prohibit discrimination against families with children, it is important for park owners and managers to make sure that all such age/occupancy requirements are properly reflected in the community's Rules and the Statement of Policy - and be consistently applied. </p><br><p>So, technically, assuming that your community demographic is well above the 80% floor, there is nothing <em>per se' </em>illegal with the situation you describe.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> Say, for example, the resident was not ill, but wanted her sister and child to live in the home with her, you could - but are not required - to grant permission. Under those circumstances, if the resident subsequently became ill and was hospitalized, thus leaving the sister and her child in the home on a temporary basis, I view that as an acceptable situation, and not a violation of the law.  Even though the resident is not ""occupying"" the home while she is in the hospital, she is the lawful occupant, and would return to that home upon her recovery.</p><br><p>There is, metaphorically speaking, another 80/20 rule: ORS Chapter 90 is, like most laws, enacted to address essentially 80% of the most commonly observed landlord-tenant issues. That leaves the other 20% to be dealt with on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis, i.e. as they arise. Your situation raises issues that while not technically addressed under the law, it is close enough, and one rather simple to justify.</p><br><ul>	<li>It is not a violation of the state and federal law;</li>	<li>It does not endanger the health, safety or welfare of others in the community; and</li>	<li>Despite some grumbling from a few residents, permitting them to stay on a temporary basis is the right thing to do, even though it may not fall directly under the temporary occupant statute. (<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.275"">ORS 90.275</a>)</li></ul><br><p>However, in order to avoid setting some sort of ""precedent"" and perhaps to quell a few complaints, you should consider having a written agreement with the sister, saying something to the effect that she and her daughter are permitted to live at the home, with the understanding that she is doing so on a temporary basis and with the knowledge and consent of the hospitalized resident; that she will abide by the community rules; and that the rent will continue to be paid on time.</p><br><p>You should, of course, continue to monitor the situation, making sure the agreement is being honored, and that there are periodic updates on the health of the resident. If it begins to appear that the resident may not be coming back to the space, you will have to address a sale of the home to another qualifying resident.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Your question did not address whether there is a second-person age requirement.

It is merely a notice, or reminder. You may issue it as frequently as necessary, and even though you are aware of the default, you may continue to accept rent without it constituting a waiver to later issue a curable 30-day notice of termination for the same non-compliance.</p><br><p>Oregon landlord-tenant law expressly allows a landlord to accept rent after becoming aware of certain violations. See, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.412"">ORS 90.412(4)(d)</a>. In summary, they include:</p><ol>	<li>Disrepair or deterioration of the <em><u>manufactured dwelling</u></em>; and</li>	<li>A failure to maintain the <em><u>rented space</u></em>.</li></ol><br><p>And <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.412"">ORS 90.412(5)(a)</a> provides that for ""ongoing violations"" (e.g. failure to maintain the space or failure to repair the home), a landlord's written warning notice (e.g. Form 47), remains effective for 12 months and may be renewed with a new warning notice before the end of the 12 months.  This has the effect of preserving the landlord's right to take action at some time in the future, while accepting rent during the interim.  Thus, Form 47 is a less aggressive version of a 30-day notice of termination of tenancy under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a> (for <em><u>space</u></em> maintenance issues), or <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.632"">ORS 90.632 </a>(for repairs to the exterior of the <em><u>home</u></em>).</p><br><p>To reiterate: If the violation relates to the <em><u>space</u></em>, and the resident has consistently refused to clean it up, Form No. 47 is appropriate. The resident must do so within 30 days, or the tenancy will automatically terminate; if the violation relates to the <em>home</em>, and the resident has refused to perform the necessary repair, Form No. 55 is appropriate. This form is similar to the 30-day notice for space maintenance, but provides additional time for compliance depending on the nature of the repair, e.g. painting, which may not be feasible during the winter months.</p><br><p>When is Form 47 appropriate? In almost all instances when the violation is not something you want to immediately terminate the tenancy for, this is the better choice. If it becomes necessary to issue a curable 30-day notice of termination under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a> for a failure to maintain the space (MHCO Form 43), or a curable 30-day notice of termination for damage or deterioration to the home (MHCO From 55) under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.632"">ORS 90.632</a>, you want to have one or more (preferably more) MHCO Form 47s in the resident's file, so it shows that you tried to work with the resident but they ignored you.</p><br><p>Remember, judges don't like terminating tenancies in manufactured housing communities, as it essentially forces the homeowner to vacate and sell their home (since the cost or ability to relocate it may be problematic based upon a lack of financial resources or the home's age).</p><p>Also, when the resident is elderly and on a fixed income, most landlords and managers would prefer not to terminate his or her tenancy based upon, say, the condition of the home, preferring instead to wait until it is sold or inherited by a family member.</p><br><p>Lastly, think of it this way: Once you issue a 30-day notice to terminate a tenancy, what are you going to do if the resident ignores you? You really have no choice but to proceed with eviction. And until you do so, you cannot accept rent from the tenant beyond the last day of the termination period. So when issuing a 30-day notice of termination, you are drawing a line in the sand, and your options become more limited. Again, would you not rather be in court on a notice of termination after having given the tenant three form 47s that were ignored? That way the judge knows that you tried to work with the resident, and that he or she brought the termination upon themselves.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1473173579,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13367,"<p><strong>Question:  </strong>A resident living alone passed away.

Your question doesn'tmake it clear whether the estate was formally filed for probate in court, in which case this ""Administrator"" would be subject to court supervision and would have to have a bond.

This duty is not triggered until the 45-day letter is sent.  Presumably you will use a good storage agreement that requires, among other things, compliance with all applicable park rules and state, federal and local laws and ordinances, including a duty to maintain the space.  On- site destruction of the home is NOT maintaining the space.  Depending upon the home's age, on site destruction could be a violation of certain environmental laws, due to potentially hazardous material used in construction.  In fact, since there is a risk that the representative will not comply with the storage agreement - based on his threat of destruction - you may want to consider - only upon the advice of your attorney - to restrict his unsupervised access to the home.  Destruction of the home would not only take it off the tax rolls in violation of Oregon property tax law, but it would prevent you, as the landlord, from selling the home upon failure of the representative to meet his obligations.  Remember, in addition to the tax collector, you have a vested interest in seeing the home sold for recoupment any sums due (arguably including attorney fees) incurred during the abandonment process.</em></li>	<li>Since the abandonment law requires that the landlord has a duty of safe keeping pending completion of the abandonment process, it is my <u>belief</u><a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> that this entitles the landlord to secure the home (e.g. with a new lock) so that heirs and others cannot enter and remove personal property.</li>	<li>A storage agreement entitles the representative to store the personal property on the space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>	<li>If such an agreement is entered into, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder (if any) until the agreement with the representative ends.</li>	<li>If the representative requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement and there is a lienholder, also, you should review subsections (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of ORS 90.675, which describes the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</li>	<li>During the term of the Storage Agreement, the representative has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir who wishes to leave the property on the space and become a tenant.  However, this prospective tenant is subject to the same statutory requirement, including landlord qualification and approval, as found in ORS 90.680 <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.680"">(linked here)</a>. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>	<li>If the representative violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it by giving at least 30 days' written notice to them stating facts sufficient to notify them of the reason for the termination.

We are not requesting that the resident re-build the structures during a specific time frame - we want the structures removed.

Give him a fixed period to complete, e.g. 30 - 45 days, during which time you should not accept any rent. If he does not comply, then you could file your eviction.</p><br><p>Alternatively, if you can do so, you may consider speaking with the resident about voluntarily removing the structures.

Assistance animals perform many disability-related functions, including but not limited to, guiding individuals who are blind or have low vision, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to sounds, providing protection or rescue assistance, pulling a wheelchair, fetching items, alerting persons to impending seizures, or providing emotional support to persons with disabilities who have a disability-related need for such support. For purposes of reasonable accommodation requests (the law does not require) an assistance animal to be individually trained or certified. While dogs are the most common type of assistance animal, other animals can also be assistance animals.""</p><br><p><strong><em>Companion Animals. </em></strong>A ""companion animal"" is more of a generic term, and the role it serves is what determines which laws will apply.</p><br><p><strong><em>Approval Requirements.  </em></strong>You are correct that you may not refuse to permit an assistance animal or service animal based upon size or breed.

Thus, the trees are the landlord's responsibility, and certainly, they cannot be left to grow to the point of prohibiting removal of a home - or to put it another way, if the trees <em><u>are</u></em> permitted to grow in such a manner as to block homes, it is the landlord's responsibility to deal with the cost of removal, so the home can be relocated.</p><br><p>As for the landlord's liability for costs to move the home, etc., I'm going out on a limb - pardon the pun - but that is really a matter of causation, i.e. why did the landslide occur?  You did not state in your question that the tenant was somehow responsible for the slide, so I'm going to assume it was an ""Act of God"". Most good liability insurance policies do cover ""Acts of God"" events, and hopefully the landlord has such a policy.</p><br><p>So if the ground moves due to earthquake, flooding, shifting, etc., the cost to relocate the home is probably something the tenant would claim against the landlord.

In fact, I believe that possibility was contemplated when the statute was drafted and/or amended.  [My answer might be different if the tenant sold the home after expiration of the 45-day letter, since the statute says that under that circumstance the home is ""conclusively presumed"" to be abandoned. To me this means that the tenant had nothing to convey.  But we'll deal with that issue another time.]</p><br><p>So the real issue is not with the abandonment statute, but with <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.680"">ORS 90.680</a>, which deals with on-site sales of the manufactured home.   In relevant part, the statute provides as follows:</p><br><ol>	<li>If the new purchaser wants to live in the home, prior to a sale, they  '_ must submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized"";</li>	<li>They may not occupy the space or the home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;</li>	<li>If the sale is not by a lienholder [it wasn'] the prospective purchaser  '_must pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant *** prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant"";</li>	<li> The landlord must accept or reject the prospective purchaser's application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application. If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' notice, this period is extended to 10 days;</li>	<li>The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant;   </li>	<li>The following apply if a landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant:	<ul>		<li>The landlord waives any right to bring an action against the tenant under the rental agreement for breach of the landlord's right to establish conditions upon and approve a prospective purchaser of the tenant's dwelling or home; </li>		<li> The prospective purchaser, upon completion of the sale, may occupy the dwelling or home as a tenant under the same conditions and terms as the tenant who sold the dwelling or home; and </li>		<li>If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may not impose conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the seller's rental agreement unless the new tenant agrees in writing.</li>	</ul>	</li></ol><br><p>So in this case, the landlord should immediately contact the new buyer, notify them that if they intend to occupy the home, they must submit an application for tenancy and bring current all unpaid accrued rents, etc. They may not occupy the home or space until they have done so and been approved as a tenant.  </p><br><p>If the purchaser is a dealer, or intending to flip the home to another prospective buyer/tenant, these same requirements would apply. Although this may require a legal opinion before proceeding, if the current buyer intends to remove the home, I would consider asserting a possessory lien on the home [i.e. it cannot be removed until payment of the past due rents, etc.]  N<strong><em>ote this is not ""legal advice"" so you must secure an opinion from your own counsel.  </em></strong></p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1553102160,1553102217,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12993,"<p><strong>Question.  </strong> What if a portion of the community previously had ground instability issues and it was determined to be in a geologically hazardous zone?

Here are my thoughts: </p><br><ol>	<li>Owner No. 1, who had knowledge of the situation has potential liability to the affected residents and Owner No. 2. Intentional non-disclosure of material information is fraudulent and actionable.  While it would be important for Owner No. 1 to disclose the condition to residents, it is a habitability situation, and, given the materiality, not waivable. In other words, unless and until the instability issue is resolved, the space should not be rented out, and Owner No. 1's liability for placing a home on the space is not reduced by disclosing it. </li></ol><br><p>A more difficult issue is whether Owner No. 1 has liability to other residents who are not affected by the unstable ground, but claim that they would not have rented a  space in the community had they known of the issue.  If, after a thorough evaluation of the entire community, it is determined that the instability is limited exclusively to one area, I submit that disclosure to existing non-affected and new residents is still the wisest course, and likely would entail no liability to Owner No. 1.  But non-disclosure leaves open the door for residents, new and existing, to claim that they cannot sell their homes because the community has been stigmatized.</p><br><ol>	<li value=""2"">As for Owner No. 1's liability to Owner No. 2, it would be based primarily upon the principle of indemnification.  Although much depends upon the terms of sale (e.g. how broad was the ""AS-IS"" clause?)<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>, I would like to say that Owner No. 2 <em>should</em> have no liability to the residents, since he was completely unaware of the adverse condition. But law and life are never so simple. </li></ol><br><p>First, Owner No. 2 now has the absolute duty of providing safe and habitable premises to the residents, i.e. the space and common areas.  As a landlord, he assumed this risk, and will likely have direct liability to the residents - even though he had no forewarning of the problem.  From a public policy standpoint, the law would say he was in the best position to insure against these risks, as they are a cost of doing business.</p><br><p>However, since Owner No. 1's non-disclosure was a material (e.g. would he have purchased the property had he known?) Owner No. 2 would likely seek recovery against him for the fraudulent concealment. </p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Although I have seen very broad ""AS-IS"" clauses in commercial transactions, they are normally couched in terms of the buyer assuming all risks of loss for matters <em>about which neither side is aware</em>.  I do not believe the clause can be used to shield a seller from intentional non-disclosure of material issues.  In other words, at the time of agreeing to ""AS-IS"" language in the sale agreement, a buyer has a right to believe the seller has disclosed all material information. </p></div></div>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1427850614,1431629719,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12975,"<p><strong><em>Question.</em></strong> I understand that MHCO has developed a new Assistance Animal Agreement.

To my knowledge, we heard of no complaints or claims arising due to problems with the form.

In an effort to better assist members, we thought it would be a good idea to review this form, the current rules and regulations, and make changes where appropriate.</span></p><br><p>As I explained in last week's article, there are several designations that first need to be clarified. A ""service animal"" under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA"") is limited solely to dogs that have been individually trained to work or perform tasks for a person with a disability, e.g. guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, or protecting a person who is having a seizure. The ADA does require that landlords make reasonable accommodations for residents with disabilities requesting to have a service animal. <em>Note that the term ""disability"" under the ADA is very, very, broad.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><strong>[1]</strong></a></em></p><br><p>Although service animals must be on leash or harness, they may also be controlled through voice commands or hand signals. <em>Service animals are not ""pets."" </em> This means, among other things, that certain park rules for pets, such as requiring residents sign a Pet Agreement, cannot be required if it is a service animal.  Dogs whose only purpose is to provide comfort or emotional support to a resident <em>do not qualify under the ADA</em>.</p><br><p>Under the Fair Housing Act, as amended, housing providers, including manufactured housing communities, must make also ""reasonable accommodations"" for persons with disabilities requesting to have an assistance animal for emotional support, or to provide other forms of help.</p><br><p>Similar to service animals, assistance animals are not regarded as ""pets,"" and residents cannot be required to sign a Pet Agreement for them.  However, assistance animals are not limited to dogs that have been specially trained.  They can include any animal that assists and performs tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability, including emotional support that alleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of a person's disability.</p><br><p>Lastly, the label ""companion animal"" is more of a generic term, and the role it serves is what determines which laws will apply.</p><br><p>What follows is a summary of the main issues addressed in MHCO's new Assistance Animal Agreement.  Without implying that the Fair Housing Council of Oregon has ""endorsed"" or ""approved"" the form, I did consult with them, and their suggestions were very helpful and insightful in developing what you see today.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p><br><ol>	<li>We note in the form that the landlord reserves the right to refuse to permit an animal becoming an assistance animal if:	<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha;"">		<li>It has previously caused verifiable and significant damage or injury to persons or property in the Community;</li>		<li>The landlord's insurance carrier would cancel, substantially increase premiums, or adversely change policy terms because of the presence of a certain breed of dog or a certain animal <u>and</u> it would impose an undue financial and administrative burden for Landlord to secure a substitute carrier which would provide coverage for the Animal.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></li>		<li>Note, however, that prior to such refusal, a Landlord should secure written verification substantiating the undue financial and administrative burden.</li>	</ol>	</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""2"">The resident with the assistance animal is responsible to see that it conforms to all of the community's rules and regulations, such as being on leash; responsibility for removal of all feces, droppings, etc.; being left unattended outside the home or space.	<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha;"">		<li>Consistent with the conduct of all animals and pets in the Community, the assistance animal may not cause any substantial damage (to persons or property), engage in threating behavior, or cause any disturbance to other residents, their guests, or any other third parties in the community.</li>		<li>We confirm in the form that by signing below, the resident confirms that he/she has reviewed the community rules and regulations as they apply to all other animals and pets in the Community.

It's one thing to be performing repairs on one's own home, and quite another to be doing so on a home intended for re-sale.

Make sure that the contractor has no complaints or other Board action.  If the home is to be sold on an installment contract, make sure a current form of security agreement is used.  Make sure the lien is properly filed with the Department of Consumer and Business Services and appears on the title to the purchaser's home until it is paid off.  Make sure the Bill of Sale and, if applicable, the retail installment contract, both have extensive AS-IS language, making no express warranties and disclaiming all implied warranties.  Make sure the buyer gets their own inspection of the home, inside and out, including all systems such as plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc.  I don't recommend letting the buyer waive the inspection - it could  come back and bite the landlord if an unknown defect is later found. The landlord wants the buyer relying on his own expert, not on anything the landlord says.

In our Statement of Policy it says that the sewer is paid by the landlord but that we could change that with a reasonable notice at any time.  Is there anything wrong in the way we handled this?  </p>",963,997,1580,16045,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Pass Through of Sewer Charges,"<p><strong>Answer. </strong> First, let me ask why we're having this discussion today, rather than <em>before</em> you began the conversion in 2011?  This is always a risky proposition, since if you converted without following the proper protocols, there could be potential liability. <em> (On the other hand, one might argue that even if it was done improperly, there is no damage, since the residents actually saved money in the process!)</em> </p><br><p>To rephrase your question, let me ask it this way:  Is it permissible to pass sewer charges directly to residents from <strong>(a)</strong> the base rent method (i.e. where it's included in base rent), to <strong>(b)</strong> a pro-rata method (i.e. where the monthly sewer bill is prorated to each resident based upon the number of occupied spaces in the community)?</p><br><p>The short answer today is ""No.""  Since the statute, ORS 90.532, is complicated, I will try to paraphrase the prohibition as follows:  <em>For rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, a landlord and tenant may <u>not</u> amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service billing from a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(i) (the base rent method) to a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) (the prorate allocation method).</em></p><br><p>If your residents are on month-to-month rentals, they ""renew"" every month.  Thus, every resident who was in the community <em>before</em> January 1, 2010 and is still there today, has a rental agreement that was entered into <em>after</em> January 1, 2010. </p><br><p>As for what to do now, I would recommend that you discuss the situation with your attorney, and proceed upon his or her recommendation. The first order of business is to make absolutely sure that your prorata method worked to your residents' financial benefit. Secondly, if financially feasible, institute a submetering system, according to the conversion laws.  As for your new residents, here is a paraphrase of what the law says:</p><br><p><em>A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.  If the sewer service is not based upon consumption of water, you may prorate.</em></p><br><p>For new residents, you do not want to put them on a base rent method with the idea that you can later convert to a pass-through method using a prorata allocation. Oregon law does not permit that method of pass-through conversions today, unless the prorate allocation method existed in the entire community before January 1, 2010.

Since we don't know who actually ""paid"" the deposit and whether it was from their combined marital funds, I think this question should be asked, assuming you have the current address for both former spouses. If they both claim 100% of the deposit, you can issue a joint check and let them fight it out. Alternatively, you can issue two checks each  for 50%, and let them deal with each other if one feels he/she go shorted. In short, it's not up to you to make a decision of one over the other regarding who gets the refunded deposit. But before playing Solomon, you should ask each of them for a jointly signed written instruction regarding disposition of the deposit. If they give you one, fine.

We have been dealing with a resident who has certain complaints against management, and finally withheld his rent.  We just issued a 72-hour notice to him, and after expiration of the 72 hours (plus three days, since we'd mailed the notice to him), we filed an eviction against him in court.  He got an attorney, filed a number of counterclaims against us, and tendered the month's rent into court. What do we do?</p>",963,997,1580,16224,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Rent Tenders and Non Payment of Rent Evictions,"<p><strong><em>Answer:  </em></strong>One of the most common types of residential eviction is also the most misunderstood - the nonpayment of rent eviction.  A good tenant's attorney can frequently retain possession for his/her client, even though they clearly failed to pay the rent when due. All it takes is a little familiarity with that labyrinthine set of statutes in the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act, or ""ORLTA."" </p><p>It is common knowledge that unless the parties have agreed otherwise, rent is due on the first day of each month.  Rent does not become delinquent until after the expiration of seven days, including the date rent is first due.  An eviction cannot be filed until after the expiration of 72 hours' written notice.  This means that the earliest a 72-hour notice may be delivered to the resident is on the 8th day of the month, and the earliest one may file for eviction is on the 11th day of the month, i.e. 72 hours hence.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p>However, oftentimes it is not until the first appearance following the filing of the eviction that the landlord discovers that the resident has gone to an attorney and is now raising various counterclaims under ORLTA. Some of these counterclaims may be without any real factual basis, and may have been raised primarily to secure either more time or some other concession from the landlord.</p><p>Assuming that the resident either has the money to pay the rent, or can somehow gather it together prior to a trial, this is a battle that the landlord is almost sure to lose. The reason is found in the rent-tender statute, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.370"">ORS 90.370</a>.  Essentially, this statute, and several cases that have construed it, permit the resident to tender the past due rent into Court, even though it was not paid during the 72-hour period set forth in the notice.  At the conclusion of the case, if the Court finds that the amount tendered into Court covers the amount found to be due, the resident automatically retains possession.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>:  Landlord files an eviction against resident based upon the failure to pay monthly rent of $400. Resident files counterclaims alleging ORLTA violations, and claims that because of the deficiencies, the ""market rent"" (as opposed to the ""contract rent"", i.e. the amount due under the rental agreement) for the premises is only $100 per month - not $400 per month.  Resident has had possession for seven month, six of which he paid the full rent that was due, and on the seventh month, i.e. the one for which the eviction was filed, he withheld the monthly rent. But he tendered the full $400 rent into court for the seventh month, and counterclaimed for $1,800, i.e. $300 for each of the prior six months' possession for which he ""overpaid"".  Assuming that the counterclaims were made in good faith, here are the various scenarios:</p><p>                        1.     <strong><em>Worst Case</em></strong><em> <strong>for Landlord</strong>:</em>  The Court finds in favor of the resident, awarding him a judgment for $1,800 (6 months X $300) plus costs and attorney fees.</p><p>                        2.  <strong><em>Best Case for Landlord</em></strong><em>:</em>  Although the Court finds <em>against </em>the resident on his counterclaims, and finds that the amount due to the landlord is the full $400, since it has already been tendered into Court, the resident is allowed to retain possession, and may submit a request for recovery of his costs and attorney fees.  This is because subsection (1)(b) of <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.370"">ORS 90.370</a> provides that ""If no rent remains due after application of this section and unless otherwise agreed between the parties, <em>a judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession</em>. (Italics mine.) Thus, the resident is still the prevailing party and entitled to an award of attorney fees.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p><p>                        The <u>only</u> exception to the ""Best Case"" scenario is where the landlord is able to convince the Court that the resident's counterclaims are improper and/or have been filed in bad faith.  If so, the rent tender will do the resident no good, and if he loses his counterclaims, he will be evicted and become subject to a judgment for the landlord's costs and attorney fees.</p><p>                        So, when should the landlord fight to evict a resident for nonpayment of rent, where the resident has tender rent into Court?  Only in the following situations: (a) Where the landlord is confident that he/she can convince the Court that the counterclaims were filed in bad faith; or, (b) Where the rent tender is believed to be inadequate and the resident's attorney does not realize that the shortfall could be tendered into Court so that no rent would remain due  '_after application of this section... .""

If a country does not license real estate brokers, the payee must be a citizen or resident of the country and represent that the payee is in the business of real estate brokerage in the other country.

First and foremost, this is not to be used as legal advice, as everyone's factual situation is different.</p><br><p>Mr. Obama's controversial (my word, not hers) amnesty program will result in approximately 4 million U.S. residents who are undocumented, coming into the United States.  Although they will have an opportunity to apply for work permits and social security numbers, many may still not have SSNs when seeking housing.</p><br><p>In pointing  out that  '_the Fair Housing Act and Oregon law apply to everyone present in the US, regardless of immigration status"" Ms. Becker suggests that there are <em>alternatives</em> to screening other than requiring proof of a SSN.  Though she recognizes the ""importance of thorough tenant screening,"" she states that:</p><br><p><strong><em>  '_criminal history information can be acquired without an SSN and, of course, current and past landlords can provide rental history and references. Applicants may be able to provide other information such as proof of ""x"" number of recent months' paid utility bills, rent, or other regular monthly bills that can show a pattern of timely payment.""</em></strong></p><br><p>However, regardless of a landlord or manager's willingness to rent or lease space to all who qualify, the litmus in screening is really what the screening company requires.  Ms. Becker suggests that rather than issuing a ""flat no,"" landlords and managers say to the applicant ""show me what you can.""<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>   She states that:</p><br><p><strong><em> '_your screening company should be able to give you an informed estimate about how much time and money an evaluation could cost.  Costs may vary so shop your screening company.  Once you have a cost estimate, inform the consumer and, if you wish and do so consistently, you may then pass this cost on to them if they want to continue with the application.""</em></strong></p><br><p>This suggestion makes the following assumptions: (a) That the applicant actually has <em>some reliable identifying information </em>sufficient to permit the a company to complete the screening process; (b) The company is capable of completing the screening process - even for an increased fee - that does not rely upon a SSN; and (c) That the screening report will provide equally reliable information as if the applicant had tendered a SSN. </p><br><p>Ms. Becker notes that an alternative to a SSN is an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number). Here is what the IRS says about ITINs:</p><br><ul>	<li><strong><em>ITINs are for federal tax reporting only, and are not intended to serve any other purpose. IRS issues ITINs to help individuals comply with the U.S. tax laws, and to provide a means to efficiently process and account for tax returns and payments for those not eligible for Social Security Numbers (SSNs). </em></strong></li>	<li><strong><em>If you do not have a SSN and are not eligible to obtain a SSN, but you have a requirement to furnish a federal tax identification number or file a federal income tax return, you must apply for an ITIN.</em></strong></li>	<li><strong><em>By law, an alien individual cannot have both an ITIN and a SSN.</em></strong></li>	<li><strong><em>For more information, go to link </em></strong><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/General-ITIN-Information""><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></li></ul><br><p>Based upon the above, this leads me to believe - or at least suspect - that the use of an ITIN is really only appropriate if the individual has a federal income tax reporting obligation and is <em>unable</em> to obtain a SSN.  So the question landlords and managers should ask their screening company is whether it can even use the ITIN for purposes of tenant screening.  If the company can do so, and the background check can be accomplished with a comparable level of accuracy as with a SSN, then the following rules should apply:</p><br><ol>	<li>If applicants do not have a SSN, but do have an ITIN, their application should be processed.</li>	<li>Make sure that the use of the ITIN in lieu of the SSN is applied evenly and consistently to ALL applicants.</li></ol><br><p>If your screening company does not use the ITIN for tenant screening, are you <em>legally required</em> to find one that does?  I will leave that question to your own attorney.  As for me, if I could pass on the added cost, if any, to the applicant <em>[as Ms. Becker's article suggests]</em>, and the company can provide equally reliable and prompt service, I would personally consider doing so.  </p><br><p>However, Ms. Becker notes in her article that:</p><br><p><strong><em>""After having consulted with screening companies and the credit bureaus, it does <u>not</u> appear that this will allow a credit report to be pulled in the same way that an SSN does.""  [Underscore mine.]</em></strong></p><br><p>That statement does not sound like a ringing endorsement by Ms. Backer of her own suggestion that landlords use an ITIN in lieu of the SSN.  In any event, it's worth a try.</p><br><p>So setting the ITIN issue aside, the FHCO's position is that:</p><br><p><strong><em> '_a refusal to review <u>alternative documentation</u> when a SSN is not available will have a negative and disparate impact on individuals whose national origin is not the US, thereby having a <u>disparate impact</u> on that protected class.  Therefore, a policy or practice of not accepting applicants because they do not have a SSN is not appropriate.  That said, we feel that passing on actual additional costs of screening in a situation like this as a legitimate business expense that could be passed on to the applicant. [Underscore mine.]</em></strong></p><br><p>Here is where Ms. Becker and I part company.  What she is saying is that: (a) Since members ostensibly of a protected class <em>[e.g. Mr. Obama's four million invitees - </em><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=obama%20giving%20social%20security%20numbers%20to%20aliens""><em>who will be given an opportunity to apply for SSNs</em></a><em>] will be adversely affected;</em> (b) By insisting exclusively on the SSN as the sole screening tool, it indirectly singles them out, and that's discriminatory.  That is what she means when she says it creates a ""disparate impact.""  So even if a manager or landlord has <em>no intent to discriminate - i.e. they are applying the SSN requirement to ALL applicants</em>, it is the FHCO's position that such a screening practice is a violation of the Federal and State Fair Housing Laws.</p><br><p>There is one problem with the above quote: Disparate impact theory has never been validated by the U.S. Supreme Court.  There are many legal scholars who maintain that the Fair Housing Act (""FHA"") was only intend to be applied to prevent <em>intentional </em>discrimination. </p><br><p>After several false starts, on January 21 of this year, the case of <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-1371_g4ek.pdf"">Texas Dept. of Housing vs. The Inclusive Communities Project</a>, was heard by the Supreme Court. In a Forbes article (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/01/21/disparate-impact-at-supreme-court/"">""Disparate-Impact Theory Finally Gets Its Test At Supreme Court""</a>) published the following oral argument on the day of the hearing, writer <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/01/21/disparate-impact-at-supreme-court/"">Daniel Fisher</a>, stated that the case:</p><br><p><strong><em> '_represents a long-awaited test of disparate impact, which critics say allows the federal government ‰ÛÓ or allied non-profit groups like Inclusive Communities ‰ÛÓ to sue businesses and housing authorities for committing racial discrimination not because an identified person discriminated but because the racial outcome was skewed one way or another."" </em></strong></p><br><p>In other words, the issue finally before the Court is whether the FHA can be used to produce racial outcomes when there is no proof of intent to discriminate. <a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>   </p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion. </em></strong>Although I disagree that landlords and managers are today engaging in illegal discrimination via disparate impact, when they rely exclusively upon SSNs as a screening tool, there are some take-aways from the Becker article I do endorse:</p><br><ul>	<li>The FHCO believes that landlords and managers should review ""alternative documentation"" protocols, rather than just saying ""No"" whenever an applicant seeks to rent or lease a space without a SSN.  I have no problem with that, and suggest park owners develop such protocols. </li>	<li>However, the protocols must produce a reasonably equivalent <em>[i.e. timely and reliable]</em>, result as when using a SSN. </li>	<li>If there are companies out there that can produce such results without SSNs - even if more costly - they should be seriously vetted. According to Ms. Becker, the cost, <em>as of today</em>, can be passed on to the applicant, should he or she choose to proceed. </li>	<li>Note that Ms. Becker is <em>not</em> saying that park owners and managers <em>must</em> use alternative procedures, even if they are bad or unreliable.  She is only saying that, if available, alternatives should be considered.<strong><em> I repeat: Landlords and managers should not initially ""screen"" [i.e. reject] all tenant applicants based solely on the fact they do not have a SSN.</em></strong><a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><em><strong>[3]</strong></em></a><strong><em> You want to see if there is an alternative screening protocol. </em></strong></li>	<li>If (a) valid alternative screening tools exist, and (b) they are equally applied, there should be no legal basis for a claim of discrimination if the tenant applicant does not pass that screening protocol.</li>	<li>Whether screening out all tenant applicants based upon their not having a SSN would result in a ""disparate impact"" against members of a protected class and therefor violate the FHA, will have to wait until the U. S. Supreme Court issues its decision.</li></ul><br><p>In the meantime, landlords and managers may want to investigate various screening companies today, to learn whether there are other suitable substitutes to using the SSN as a screening tool.  If there are, and they prove reliable, these alternatives should be included on a written list and provided to tenant applicants preferably upon first face-to-face contact.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>  Remember to be consistent and apply this approach across the board to ALL tenant applicants. To be absolutely safe, I would even go so far as to say that the list - if one can be developed - should be given to all applicants with the rest of the park's paperwork. In other words, don't ask the applicant if they have a SSN, and if they do not, then refuse to give them an application. If there are comparable alternatives that a screening company will accept, then you may use one of them.    </p><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> I respectfully submit that ""show me what you can"" is an insufficient and slightly misleading approach to the issue, as it is too open-ended.  It implies that the applicant need only produce what they can.  I suggest that the proper approach is to ask:  ""<em>Show me the best documentation you have of your identity."" </em>If the applicant produces a valid birth certificate or a valid driver's license, it may suffice for the screening company. If he or she produces a library card as the ""best evidence,"" there may be some difficulty in its suitability for use by the screening company.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> I wrote a blog post explaining disparate impact late last year, before the case was argued.

One of the tenants has accused the other of having late night outside visitors and possible distribution of drugs, and vandalism to his property.  He has recently installed a security system to his home that includes cameras. One of those cameras is focused on his storage shed and also includes a view of the neighbor's front porch and front door. My manager knows of the security set up and wanted to know if this situation can lead to an invasion of privacy claim by one tenant against the other tenant. Now that the manager knows this, is there some action we should take?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16162,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Tenant Video Cameras,"<p><strong>Answer:  </strong>I doubt the park rules contain anything about privacy rights or the use of video cameras.  As to laws being broken by the use of the camera, I don't believe there are any.  Thus, I don't seen any management responsibility at this point.  In other words, if the rental agreement, rules, or laws are not being broken, there would be no basis for management to treat the use of the camera as something for which the tenancy can be terminated, say, under a 30-day notice pursuant to <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a>. </p><br><p><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">ORS 90.740</a> enumerates several duties of residents in manufactured housing communities.  <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">Subsection (4)(j) </a>provides they must: ""Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors.""  Video taping from a stationary location, does not, in my opinion, appear to violate this law. If one resident followed the other around with a camera throughout the park, that would be another issue.  </p><br><p>Let's call the resident with the camera, ""Resident A"", and the one with the late-night visitors, ""Resident B"". Your question did not say whether Resident B was aware of the video camera or that it was trained at his front door.  Nor did you indicate whether the video camera also had audio capability, such that it could pick up Resident B's outdoor conversations with his late night guests.</p><br><p>In Oregon, ORS 165.540(1)(c) forbids a person from obtaining or attempting to obtain ""the whole or any part of a conversation by means of any device, contrivance, machine, or apparatus, whether electrical, mechanical, manual or otherwise, if not all participants in the conversation are specifically informed that their conversation is being obtained.""  Note that informing the participants is required, but consent from them is not.  Subsection (3) of the statute provides that the above prohibitions do not apply to conversations that occur inside a homeowner's residence, - even though the guests and visitors are not informed.</p><br><p>Although audio recordings are addressed by the above Oregon statute, video recordings are not. Nonetheless, the general rule, at least from a civil law standpoint, is whether the (e.g. Resident B) has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Doing drug deals <em>outside </em>is most likely an activity Resident B and his guests have no reasonable basis to expect privacy.</p><br><p>Certainly, Resident A can use the cameras on his own property and the streets, sidewalks, and any other public and quasi-public areas. Can the camera be trained on the front door of Resident B, as he admits his late night visitors? I cannot render a legal opinion on this, but would speculate that since it is outdoors, albeit on Tenant A's own property, video recording should be OK (not audio recording, however).  But even if it's not OK, is this a fight management wants to take up? This is not as if Resident A is screaming at Resident B's late night guests, or is otherwise causing any disruption in the park.  If Resident B knows of the video surveillance, consent would seem to be a moot issue.  It would be prudent for Resident A to let Resident B know he has installed a security system that includes video surveillance.  The manager should encourage Resident A to do so, or authorize him (the manager) to do so.  Once informed, the entire expectation of privacy analysis becomes moot.</p><br><p>Lastly, I'm curious is Resident B's activity is bothering anyone else?  If so, it may be time to take action.  I have always maintained that with residents whose late night activities smack of drug dealing, with all the typical indicators such as multiple visitors, noise, and short-term visits, etc., a 30-day curable notice under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a> is a much easier tool to use as the basis of an eviction, than to try to ""prove"" a violation of <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.396"">ORS 90.396 (1)(f)(B)</a>, which allows the issuance of a non-curable 24-hour notice for the manufacture, delivery, or possession of a controlled substance as defined by various Oregon statutes. </p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1442939755,1534198304,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13222,"<p><strong>Question One: </strong>  If a community is a legal 55+ park, is it still subject to the federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against children?  </p><p><strong>Question Two:  </strong>If the current rules in a family community <em>appear</em> to be discriminatory towards children -- e.g. they place restrictions that have a discriminatory impact on children or persons with children (e.g. curfew on children, even if it's intended to be for their own safety) can the landlord unilaterally amend the rules, or does he/she need to go through the formal rule change process outlined in the <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.610"">ORS 90.610</a>?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16322,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A - Two Question on Children and 55 & Older Communities,"<p><strong>Answer to Question 1:  </strong>Generally, no. However, this isn'ta license to be rude to them.  Let's start with the basics:  If you are a legal 55+ community, you are not required to admit as residents, persons with children, i.e. those under the age of 18.  If there are children in the community (perhaps before the facility converted to 55+, or simply because less than 20% of all spaces are occupied by persons <em>with</em> children), the park may do things that it could not do if it was a family park, such as prohibit children's Big Wheels and bicycles in the street.  Generally, however, the best approach is to strive for 100% compliance with the 55+ laws in terms of occupancy.  If you want to be a ""safe"" 55+ community, you will have rules that expressly say so; a rental/lease agreement that expressly says so; application and tenant home sale provisions that limit spaces to at least one occupant 55+; and generally hold yourself out in all advertising as a 55+ community.  Of course, seniors are permitted to bring children (e.g. grandchildren, etc.) into the community, but the rules may place limits on the amount of time they may remain there. </p><p><strong>Answer to Question 2:  </strong>You need to go through the formal rule change process described in the statute.  A rule that is not legally enacted, isn'treally an enforceable rule.  However, you should immediately issue a written notice to all residents that based upon legal advice, those rules (identifying them) that appear to be discriminatory against children, will not be enforced.  If you own a family park and are concerned that your rules may appear to ""target"" children, you should consult with your attorney for advice on how to proceed.  Note that even if your rules don't appear to target children, if they, in fact, affect the activities of children more heavily than adults, they could still be deemed to be discriminatory (e.g. occupancy limits).  And if you are a family park, but you have over 80% of the spaces occupied by at least one person age 55 or over, you should ask your attorney about ""converting"" to become a legal 55+ community.  Until you do, even though 99% of the community's spaces are occupied by seniors, you're still a family park, and subject to the anti-discrimination laws protecting children. </p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1475089109,1499637261,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13217,"<p align=""center""><strong>Question No. 1. </strong>We are currently in the process of submetering our community and we have been asked a question by the residents that we run into frequently.

The rent reduction may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the utility or service cost averaged over at least the preceding one year. *** Before the landlord first bills the tenant using the submeter method, the landlord shall provide the tenant with written documentation from the utility or service provider showing the landlord's cost for the utility or service provided to the facility during at least the preceding year.</p><br><p>The source of this confusion lies in the fact that utilities are paid for in arrears (i.e. based on meter readings <em>after</em> the service has been provided). However, rent is always paid for in advance (i.e. <em>before</em> the occupancy commences for the current month).</p><br><p>So, on December 1, when you were still charging residents a gross rent figure (inclusive of utilities)<em> from their point of view </em>it was to cover all utilities for the entire month, going forward. Thus, their first direct utility payment on January 15 would appear, <em>from their point of view</em>, to include the December 15 - 31 period, and therefore be a ""double payment"" - i.e. something they'd effectively paid for in their December gross rent payment. </p><br><p>But in actuality, when the residents paid their gross rent on December 1 - inclusive of utilities - it was correctly used by you to pay the December 15 utility bill which covered the November 15 - December 15 period.  What you paid for on December 15 was never applied by your provider to the remainder of the month going forward, i.e. December 15 to December 31. Thus, the December 15-31 utility period remained unpaid, and could not be paid until the following month, i.e. January 15.</p><br><p>On January 1, when the residents pay their new reduced rent, it will not include sewer and water. And on January 15, when they directly pay their utility provider, it will be based upon the water meter readings for the period of December 15 to January 15. </p><br><p>Does this mean that when the residents pay the utilities on January 15, they are picking up one half of a utility bill you should be paying, i.e. the December 15 - 31 utilities?  I don't believe so. Until their January 15 payment, the utility bill for the December 15-31 period <em>had never been paid</em>.</p><br><p>Conversely, if you were required to make a partial payment toward the utility bill on January 15, 2017 covering the last 16 days of December, the result would be that (a) on December 15 you would have paid for utilities <em>going back</em> to November 15, and (b) on January 15 you would have paid for utilities covering the period from December 15 to December 31, i.e. a 45-day period - even though the residents only paid December's rent.</p><br><p>As confusing as this is, I'm comfortable that the residents are not making a ""double payment"", in that they are not paying for something that was already paid before, and now they are paying again. The utilities for the period of December 15 - 31 were never paid in December.</p><br><p><strong>Question No. 2. </strong>Our community was submetered a few years ago.  At first the tenants paid exactly what the city's charges were for water and sewer.  The city had a structured billing arrangement for sewer, which annualized the costs over the entire calendar year. Since sewer bills are tied to the water consumption, annualizing them reduced the summer sewer bills (when water consumption is higher) than they would have been if directly tied to actual water consumption. Then the sewer rates changed with no further annualization.  So the sewer bill is now quite high in the summer. My question is:  What do the submetering statutes say about what can be charged to the residents?  Can a park charge exactly what the city charges for residential water and sewer?  I have read that the owner of the park cannot make a profit on the water charges. But charging the same as the city shouldn'tcause a profit for the owner, should it? <br /> </p><p><strong>Answer. </strong> <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.536"">ORS 90.536</a> provides that subject to the following exceptions, a landlord <em>may not bill or collect more money from tenants for utilities or services than the utility or service provider charges the landlord</em>.

Today, the rule of thumb should be that subject to certain exceptions (listed below), you should not summarily reject applicants solely because of prior convictions.  I have written and spoken on this issue during 2016. </p><br><p>On April 4, 2016, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") issued its ""Office of General Counsel Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related Transactions"" (hereinafter, the ""Memo""). The full text of the 10-page Memo can be found <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=hud%20guidance%20criminal%20records"">here</a>. Not surprisingly, it follows the June 25, 2015 ruling by the U. S. Supreme Court, in the <a href=""http://q-law.com/texas-dept-housing-vs-inclusive-communities-means-fair-housing-law/""><em>Texas Dept. of Housing vs. Inclusive Communities</em> </a>case, which upheld the much-debated concept of ""disparate impact"" under the Fair Housing Act, as amended (the ""Act""). </p><br><p>Disparate impact holds that certain practices in employment, housing, etc., may be considered discriminatory under the Act, if they have a disproportionately ""adverse impact"" on certain members of a protected class, i.e. those falling into the following groups: Race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status or national origin.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>  The simplest explanation of how disparate impact works is by the following example from the Memo:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Today, a landlord may be found to have discriminated against a prospective tenant, not because of an intentional discriminatory act, such as rejecting him or her based upon race or religion, but <em>unintentionally</em>, because the landlord relied upon a perfectly legal basis, except that it had a disproportionately adverse impact on members of a protected class.  Proof of the ""disproportional impact"" is usually based upon some statistical correlation showing that a certain class of protected persons are negatively impacted more than others. In other words, <em>unintentional discrimination</em> can now be a violation of the Act.</p><br><p>The purpose of the Memo was to issue guidance, mostly by way of examples and prior case law, in how the use of criminal history during the tenant-screening process, may, or may not, trigger a disparate impact result.</p><p>Although, ironically, the Memo on deals with cases of disparate impact affecting members of ""protect classes"".<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>  However, for purposes of this discussion, it is well to apply these guidelines across the board, regardless of protected class. Otherwise, there is the possibility, perhaps remote, that a landlord could be accused of reverse discrimination, for applying one set of criteria to members of protected class, and another set to members outside the class. Crazy huh?</p><br><p><strong><em>Summary of Thoughts and Suggestions</em></strong>.  Here are some tips based upon information from the Memo:</p><br><ol>	<li><strong><em>Beware of testers calling over the phone and asking if you will rent to persons with a criminal background.</em></strong> Be careful about answering these blind calls with a ""yes"" or ""no"". Make sure callers understand that no rental decisions are made in advance of reviewing all relevant background information, including a criminal background report. Encourage the caller to either come to the office and pick up the necessary paperwork, or if they prefer, send it to them at their provided address.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""2""><strong><em>Ultimately, landlords should plan on making adjustments in their rules and application process.  </em></strong></li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3""><strong><em>Do not have a rule or policy that treats an arrest, with no conviction, the same as a conviction.</em></strong> If you currently have such a rule, it should not be enforced.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4""><strong><em>Do not have a blanket guideline providing, for example, that conviction for <u>any</u> crime is an automatic denial.</em></strong></li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""5""><strong><em>Be sure that all rules and policies concerning criminal records are uniformly enforced - no exceptions.  </em></strong>However, note No. 7 below. You should avoid a policy saying that all persons with a felony are automatically disqualified. There is a world of difference between an ex-felon who served time for embezzlement ten years ago and has been a contributing member of society ever since vs. an ex-felon who served time for aggravated battery, and has been in and out of jail for similar violent crimes over the past five years.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""6""><strong><em>If possible, evaluate all other rental history, such as prior tenancies, employment, credit, income and affordability, before even going to the results of a criminal background check. </em></strong>If the prospective tenant does not pass one or more of these other criteria, then the rejection can be based on that, rather than a criminal background report, thus avoiding the disparate impact issue entirely.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""7""><strong><em>In evaluating an applicant's criminal history, do not use a ""one size fits all"" approach. </em></strong>There are several gradations of severity.

This is not like an adult who wants to be approved as a resident and move in to an existing home.  In that case, I can see that you would want to run him through the fully battery of checks.</p><p>But in this case, what would you learn? You would not be able to get any juvenile records. He probably has no credit to speak of, and his income is not necessary for establishing that his parents can afford to live in the community. It strikes me that going forward, you retain the same control over him as any other adults in the park. He has to obey the rules, etc., and if he doesn'tyou could issue a 30-day notice to the parents about his conduct.  </p><p>If you wanted to add him as a Temporary Occupant, you could do that. If he violated rules, etc., you could terminate his right to be a Temporary Occupant, and require that he vacate.  However, in this case, it does not seem that there is cause for concern.</p><p> If he had been a problem child, and now had grown into a problem adult, I would strongly recommend that you use a Temporary Occupancy Agreement. Your options in requiring that he vacate upon breach of the rules, are much swifter, although you cannot terminate without cause.</p><p>Although I don't believe I've seen this issue addressed in park rules, it's not a bad idea to have something in place. You could say that all children remaining in the park after their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, must do X, Y, and Z. That way, when it happens, you will not be accused of picking on one particular tenant's son or daughter.</p><p>Lastly, I've often seen a similar situation, where the child moves away after his or her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, and then returns a year or so later. Some landlords treat this as they would any other third party wanting to move into an existing resident's home. While it would be nice if the situation was addressed in the community rules, I have not seen this. I believe I would treat any adult wanting to share space with other residents, even parents, the same way I would treat unrelated parties; they must at least pass a background check. The rule should be the same for two residents who have been approved, then one leaves and comes back a year or so later.</p><p>In all cases, you can use the Occupancy Agreement, assuming the person passes their background check. If there is ever any doubt about the boomerang child, or former tenant coming back into the community, your best alternative (other than saying ""No"" based upon the background check) is to use the Temporary Occupancy Agreement.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>  However, never let the Temporary Occupancy Agreement be perpetual; be sure to have an expiration date on the term.

That would include earthquakes, windstorms, floods, tsunamis, etc. If you are asking about insurance exclusions for Acts of God, you'll have to read you policy. Generally, however, as a landlord, you should make sure you have broad general casualty insurance coverage (as opposed to liability insurance coverage), since the former would cover casualty losses (fire, wind, flood, etc.), regardless of causation or negligence, whereas the latter would provide coverage for you only if you <em><u>caused</u></em> the damage. Broad insurance coverage against casualty losses, e.g. from Acts of God, is what community owners should have. Whether residents have such coverage is less certain, since the rental/lease agreements I've seen either do not require any form of insurance, or occasionally only liability insurance. And unless their lender requires it, it is unlikely that many owners of older homes have any insurance against loss or damage.</p><br><p><strong><u>Answer to Question No. 2</u></strong>. As to uprooted trees, let's go to the legal definitions. A ""hazard tree"" under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.100"">ORS 90.100(20)</a> must include the following elements:</p><ul>	<li>It is located  <em><u>on a rented space</u></em> in  a manufactured dwelling park;</li>	<li>It measures  at  least  <em><u>eight  inches  DBH</u></em><a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>;  and</li>	<li>It is  <em><u>considered, by  an  arborist</u></em> licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/671.560"">ORS  671.560</a> and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, <em><u>to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage</u></em>  to individuals or  property in the  near  future. (Emphasis mine.)</li></ul><br><p>I draw certain corollaries from this definition - some may disagree:</p><ul>	<li>A tree is a large living plant that grows out of the ground; if it is blown down, it is no longer a ""tree"" in the conventional sense. I have no recollection of discussing downed trees as ""trees"" that would somehow be subject to the hazard tree legislation. I would defer to John VanLandingham's recollection on this, however.  This answer would seem to dispose of the above question, but I will continue, just to address the other unasked questions that will inevitably arise.</li>	<li>If a tree does not measure at least eight inches, DBH, it is <em><u>not</u></em> a ""hazard tree"". This is not to say that the tree is necessarily ""safe"" or that it may be ignored by landlord or resident.  In the final analysis, landlord and managers should monitor the condition of all trees, both in the common areas, and on the tenants' spaces. Just because a tree is not a hazard tree does not mean they can be ignored. Similarly, just because the tree is a resident's responsibility does not mean it should be ignored by management. If it is the resident's responsibility, management should encourage compliance - since a falling tree limb or the entire tree, may cause damage or injury to other spaces and other residents.</li>	<li>If a licensed arborist has either said the subject tree does not pose a risk of harm, or the arborist has never opined at all, it is <em><u>not</u></em> a ""hazard tree"". Again, this does not mean the tree may, or should be, ignored.</li>	<li>Lastly, remember that all of the above three elements (on the resident's space; eight inches DBH, and considered dangerous by a licensed arborist) must occur together before a tree can be considered a ""hazard tree"". </li></ul><p>Once it meets the statutory definition, then the legal obligations found in <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.725"">ORS 90. 725</a>, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.727"">90.727</a>, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">90.730</a>, and <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">90.740</a> apply.  </p><br><br><p><strong><u>Answer to Questions Nos. 3 &amp; 4</u></strong><strong>. </strong>I believe the answer to who responsibility for maintenance, removal and disposal are addressed in <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.727"">ORS 90.727</a> (Maintenance of trees in rented spaces). Although the statutes do not referral to ""disposal"" they do refer to removal.  I read these words as interchangeable in this context.  For example, removal of garbage and debris from one's yard, reasonably includes disposal.  The statute provides: </p><p>(1) As used in this section:</p><p>      (a) ""Maintaining a tree"" means removing or trimming a tree for the purpose of eliminating features of the tree that cause the tree to be hazardous, or that may cause the tree to become hazardous in the near future.</p><p>      (b) ""Removing a tree"" includes:</p><p>      (A) Felling and removing the tree; and</p><p>      (B) Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p><br><p>I suppose the next question is whether ""removing a tree"" can refer to downed trees. I think not, since the follow text quoted above, refers to ""felling"" it.  </p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion.  </em></strong>As noted above, landlords, more likely than residents, have insurance that deals with Acts of God. These types of natural events do not distinguish between whose property is affected, e.g. common areas vs. resident spaces. In some instances, strict enforcement of the hazard tree statute could impose a catastrophic expense to a resident that might be covered under the landlord's insurance. In such cases, consideration should be given to providing assistance/coverage rather than forcing a tenant into bankruptcy or financial distress.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><br><br><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> I regard a tree never ""planted by the tenant or landlord"" as owned by the landlord, since they own the ground.

(3) A landlord: (a) Shall maintain a tree that is a hazard tree, that was not planted by the current tenant, on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park if the landlord knows or should know that the tree is a hazard tree.

(4) A landlord shall comply with ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant's space to inspect or maintain a tree.  (5) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a tenant is responsible for maintaining the trees on the tenant's space in a manufactured dwelling park at the tenant's expense. The tenant may retain an arborist licensed as a landscape construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society of Arboriculture to inspect a tree on the tenant's rented space at the tenant's expense and if the arborist determines that the tree is a hazard, the tenant may: (a) Require the landlord to maintain a tree that is the landlord's responsibility under subsection (3) of this section; or (b) Maintain the tree at the tenant's expense, after providing the landlord with reasonable written notice of the proposed maintenance and a copy of the arborist's report. (6) If a manufactured dwelling cannot be removed from a space without first removing or trimming a tree on the space, the owner of the manufactured dwelling may remove or trim the tree at the dwelling owner's expense, after giving reasonable written notice to the landlord, for the purpose of removing the manufactured dwelling.</p></div></div>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1496335631,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12977,"<p><strong>Question.  </strong>I understand that there are different methods to serve notices on residents.

My approach is to assume that Murphy's Law is ever-present, so I err on the side of being too cautious.</p><ol>	<li>When calculating days or hours, always add a few extra just to be safe.  Just because it's called a ""72-hour notice,"" doesn'tmean you can't add a few more hours. Same for 24-hour notices.</li>	<li>don't forget the additional 3-day period for mailing. It applies to virtually all written notices you give, from 30-day notices, to park closure notices.

If someone other than the tenant comes to the door, I'd think twice about making ""substituted service,"" as it's too easy for the person answering to ""forget,"" and you've now got an issue you could have avoided. I suggest finding out when the resident is returning, and come back. Never deliver the notice to a child or teenager - for obvious reasons. If they won't answer the door, don't think you can slip it under the door, behind the screen, or drop it in an open window.  Just go back to the office and mail it regular mail.</li>	<li>Never, never, never use certified mail or any other form of delivery like UPS or Fed Ex.</li>	<li>Remember, if the written notice is properly addressed, stamped and posted, the law ""presumes"" receipt. While the resident can try to deny it, the ""presumption"" requires them to prove a reason for non-receipt, which is pretty difficult to do. I've never seen the argument work.   A good precaution is to obtain a certificate of mailing from the post office, which confirms that you posted the letter.</li>	<li>I'm not a fan of nail and mail. Unless your rental agreement permits it both ways, i.e. from landlord to tenant, and <em>vice versa</em>,<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> you should not use this method.

However, my strong preference is to <u>mail all notices</u>, making sure to add at least three days. I prefer this approach since the law presumes receipt, so long as it was properly addressed, stamped and posted.

We understand that DOR is now showing up on the DCBS records. Remember, if they show up on the record and you fail to give them notice, they could come back against the park for failing to notify them. If they show up on the DCBS records, they should be copied on the 45-day letter, and given all of the same rights as other lienholders, e.g. entering into a one year storage agreement, paying the storage fees, selling the home, etc. Currently, it is our understanding the DOR does not sign and returned storage agreements. If there is a purchase money lien on the property, it will be superior to the DOR and then it [the DOR] will only get payment if there is any equity from the sale. Since the property is worth more than $8,000, if there is no sale, it would go to auction. [Caveat: Even if the DOR doesn'trespond to the 45-day letter, they still must be notified of the upcoming auction, per the statute. Again, there could be liability to the DOR if they have a valid lien, got the 45-day letter, but weren'tinformed of the date and time of the auction.] As a lienholder, the DOR is behind the park, in terms of payment of cost, and then the county tax collector [which presumably is current - thanks to the DOR]. Next, as a lienholder, the DOR would receive some payment. If there are any further proceeds, they would go to the tenant, and if the tenant cannot be located, then to the county fund.

(b) Can he bid during the sealed bid process?

The entire statute, which is lengthy, is found at ORS 90.675. (a) Can a landlord acquire a home that is in abandonment? Yes. Assuming that the abandonment process has been formally commenced, the landlord would have to wait for the 45 day period to expire and then if the property was over $8,000, it would have to be advertised and sold via sealed bid. The landlord can bid, but must make sure that the bid is high enough that it's not going to be snapped up by another higher bid. If the property is worth $8,000 or less, the landlord could dismantle or give away to a non-profit organization. But if the landlord wanted the home, he would have to advertise and auction and then pay the property taxes and could acquire it. (b) Can he or she bid during the sealed bid process? Yes, as mentioned above. However, sealed bids mean sealed bids - no free peek by the landlord, so he knows how much to make his bid for. The playing field must be level. (c) If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase it and at what price? Generally this should not come up, since the landlord would normally put in his own ""protective bid"" which is just a credit bid and represents the amount of costs and fees he's got into the abandonment process. Thus, if no one else were to bid, the landlord would acquire it for the ""protective bid."" The above discussion does not factor in what happens if there is a lender. If there is, then the entire time frame is subject to what the lender does. If it signs and returns the Storage Agreement, then the lender will have the right to try to sell the property itself. However, if the lender does not sign and return the Storage Agreement, or otherwise fails to respond to the landlord, then its interest is ""conclusively presumed to be abandoned."" Note, however, that when the home is advertised prior to the private auction, the invitation to bid submitted to the newspaper for publishing must also be provided to the lender - even though it didn'trespond to the original 45-day notice. This is sometimes forgotten, since landlords assume that if the lender didn'trespond or timely exercise their right to sell the property, they don't have a right to know when the auction is held. They do have the right to know, and the right to bid. Forgetting this can create headaches for landlords after they have sold the property to someone else.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1342457839,1402808807,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13428,"<p><strong><em>Question: </em></strong>    We are currently dealing with an abandoned home where the tenant has passed away and he was in a ""Senior Tax Deferral"" program through the Oregon Dept. of Revenue (""DOR"").

I know the applicant to have several judgments against him. He says they have all been taken care of but I don't believe him. I really don't want to spend time processing the application. Do I have to accept and process the application?</p>",963,997,1580,15717,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Accepting Application When You Suspect Applicant Does Not Qualify.,"<p>Answer: A judgment is a lien on all real property that is owned by the judgment debtor in the county in which the debtor resides. The lien gives the judgment creditor the right to ""execute"" on that real property, i.e. force a sale of the property with the proceeds being applied toward payment of the judgment. It is good for ten years and can be renewed for another ten years. If the creditor doesn'tknow if the debtor owns property in a particular county he can record the judgment there anyway (or some counties or every county in Oregon), and it will immediately attach if property is located there. This means that if the debtor attempts to dispose of, or mortgage, the property, the judgment lien will prevent the transaction until the creditor is paid in full. Judgments carry interest at 9% per annum. If the judgment debtor does not own any real property to which the lien can attach, he can still try to get paid, either through garnishment of wages or bank accounts, or execution upon other of the debtor's assets. If the creditor doesn'tknow what assets the debtor has, he can subpoena him into court, place him under oath, and ask questions about the existence and whereabouts of the debtor's assets. As you can see, armed with a recorded judgment, a creditor can make a debtor's life somewhat unpleasant. Once the judgment is satisfied, the debtor should insist that the creditor remove the lien by recording a Satisfaction of Judgment. This has the effect of nullifying the judgment and it will no longer appear as a negative comment on his credit history. In your case, you should tell the person that as long as the judgments appear on the record, it will appear on his credit report, affect his credit score, and could interfere with his ability to qualify to rent a space in your community. If, indeed, the liens have been taken care of, he needs to have the judgment creditors each record a Satisfaction of Judgment. A word of caution: ORS 90.680(6)(b) says that a landlord may not unreasonably reject a tenant's prospective purchaser. My concern here is that if you reject the purchaser before running the background check, you face a potential claim from the existing tenant that your rejection in advance, was per se unreasonable. Furthermore, if the applicant is a member of a protected class, you could be setting yourself up for a fair housing claim. Please consider this: If these are old judgments or very small amounts, they may say little about his qualifications as a tenant. It may be that no collection efforts are being made. Most collection agencies do not want to spend a lot of time chasing small sums, or if they do, they will discount the amount for a cash payment. How recent are the judgments? Is he gainfully employed? How long has he been employed? What is his debt-to-income ratio? His rental history? How is he paying for the home? If you don't know the answer to these questions, perhaps you should consider running the report just to find out. Since he is paying the cost of the credit check, completing the process may be your best and safest course of action, rather than ""assuming"" it's as bad as you think because of the unsatisfied judgments. It is far easier to say ""No"" after the credit, criminal, and background checks, because - if you're right - you'll have something to base the rejection on. Rejecting him in advance gives you no such safe harbor protection.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1378829845,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13374,"<p><strong>Question:  </strong>When can a manager refuse payment by check?

The City of Gresham is now charging a ""Public Safety Fee"" on every mobile home space in the city. It starts at $2.40/month/space and escalates to $7.19/month/space in June. Park owners have to pay the fee for all residents and then try to collect it back from them. If the residents have their own utility accounts with the City, they pay their fee directly, but most parks pay water and sewer utilities in bulk.

First, one caveat: This Answer is not intended to constitute legal advice. It is educational only, and should not be relied upon by an MHCO member in lieu of consulting their own legal counsel, who is familiar with their own specific factual situation. Let's start with a definition of a ""utility"" under Oregon's Residential Landlord Tenant Act. Like all legislation coming out of Salem, there is no easy answer. The statute is found at ORS 90.315. I will try to summarize the relevant portions for purposes of this Answer: Oregon Law. 90.315 Utility or service payments; additional charges; responsibility for utility or service; remedies. - A ""Utility or service"" includes but is not limited to electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal. [Italics mine. PCQ] - A landlord must disclose to the tenant in writing at or before the commencement of the tenancy any utility or service that the tenant pays directly to a utility or service provider that benefits, directly, the landlord or other tenants. A tenant's payment for a given utility or service benefits the landlord or other tenants if the utility or service is delivered to any area other than the tenant's dwelling unit. [Italics mine.] _ If a landlord knowingly fails to disclose such payments, the tenant may recover twice the actual damages sustained or one month's rent, whichever is greater. - A utility or service charge may only include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the provider. _ A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if: - The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage; - The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant; - The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage; - The written rental agreement must describe the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge; and - Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge. - A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage. - A utility or service charge, including any additional amounts added pursuant to the provisions immediately above, is not rent or a fee. - Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause. - If a landlord fails to comply with the paragraphs above regarding disclosure of the additional charges, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one month's periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant, whichever is greater. Without getting into a detailed discussion of the pass-through laws contained in ORS 90.531 - 90.530, suffice it to say that subject to several limitations, park landlords are permitted to pass through utility and service charges to their tenants. So assuming that the landlord's pass-through program was legally implemented and is legally described in the written rental agreement, the issue is whether the City of Gresham's ""Public Safety Fee"" constitutes a ""utility or service,"" as described in ORS 90.315(1)(b), which provides that it includes but is not limited to:  '_electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal."" Clearly, the statute, by its own terms, says that a ""utility or service"" can include more than what is described above. Unfortunately, it gives no guidance as to what that might be. A quick online check of Oregon definitions, seem to presuppose a ""public utility""; e.g. sewer, water and electricity. How, the definition of ""utility"" is much more generic, i.e. ""something useful."" Moreover, we can see from the examples given in the ORS 90.315(1)(b), that several are not publicly owned. And the word ""service"" is so open-ended as to defy a specific definition, other than ""something provided."" Accordingly, the definition of a ""utility or service"" is not rigidly defined by ORS 90.315, and, depending on the circumstances, can include charges for ""useful things or services"" imposed by a government body, even though they were not specifically enumerated in ORS 90.315(1)(b). City of Gresham's Explanation. Now let's look at the City of Gresham; how do they describe it and what is it intended to do? On its website explaining the fee, the City goes to great lengths to call it ""temporary."" It is a single line-item that is added to customers' water bills. It appears under the heading ""Residential Utility Charges."" The Gresham website explanation of the fee is the following: ""The temporary Police, Fire and Parks Fee *** goes into effect Feb. 1 for single-family households, multifamily property owners and businesses to help maintain essential police positions and keep our fire stations open. The per-unit fee was shaped by a public input process in 2012 and includes a phase-in for multifamily properties."" The website's FAQs add the following points: - 95% of the fee proceeds will be used to support public safety services. The remaining five percent will go toward Parks. - Whether or not the fee will be passed on to a tenant will be determined by the lease or rental agreement. - Financial assistance is available to those who qualify. A rental assistance program has been created to help low-income families and individuals pay the fee. Contact Human Solutions at 503-548-0200. The City offers an assistance program that provides emergency funds to help qualified utility customers that are experiencing financial hardship. Apply for the utility bill assistance program at 503-618-2373. Non-profit housing providers who own and operate multifamily properties that are restricted as low-income housing by a recorded regulatory agreement or by the Office of Housing and Urban Development may be eligible for assistance. For more information contact Rachael Fuller at 503-618-2255 or Rachael.Fuller@GreshamOregon.gov. - Owners of multifamily properties will be charged the fee per unit in the building. However, those with more than three units have been granted a gradual phase-in period. These property owners will pay: A 4.1% vacancy discount will be applied to the fee for all multifamily development. Multi-family property owners will pay: _ $2.50 per unit for February-March _ $5 per unit for April-May _ $7.50 per unit from June 2013-June 2014 Conclusion. I have not conducted an in-depth evaluation of this issue or the law. Subject to that limitation, it appears to me that a good argument can be made that the Public Safety Fee is either a utility or a fee, and as such, may be properly passed through to community residents. And since it is a prorated flat fee, it cannot be said to benefit other tenants or the landlord. If and when passed through, it should certainly be explained to the residents, and appear as a separate line item on their invoice.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1364497604,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13020,"<p><strong><em>In early June, following my article titled ""Home Fire in the Community"" (</em></strong>Phil Querin Q&amp;A: Home Burns Down in Community - What next? - Published June 4, 2015<strong><em>) I received an email from </em></strong><a href=""http://www.osbar.org/members/membersearch_display.asp?b=781010&amp;s=1""><strong><em>John Van Landingham</em></strong></a><strong><em> with a 'gentle reminder' that ""...</em></strong><strong><em>you might want to add that, if a governmental agency posts the burned-out home as constituting a health hazard, the abandoned property timelines can be shortened. </em></strong><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.675""><strong><em>ORS 90.675 (21)</em></strong></a><strong><em>.""

The full text of the 10-page Memo can be found <u>here</u>. Not surprisingly, it follows the June 25, 2015 ruling by the U. S.

Make sure callers understand that no rental decisions are made in advance of reviewing all relevant background information, including a criminal background report. Encourage the caller to either come to the office and pick up the necessary paperwork, or if they prefer, send it to them at their provided address.  </li></ol><p style=""margin-left: 1.5pt;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""2""><em>Ultimately, landlords should plan on making adjustments in their rules and application process.  </em> </li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3""><em>Do not have a rule or policy that treats an arrest, with no conviction, the same as a conviction.</em>If you currently have such a rule, it should not be enforced. </li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4""><em>Do not have a blanket guideline providing, for example, that conviction for any crime is an automatic denial.</em> </li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""5""><em>Be sure that all rules or policies concerning criminal records are uniformly enforced - no exceptions.  </em>However, note No. 7 below. You should avoid a policy saying that all persons with a felony are automatically disqualified. There is a world of difference between an ex-felon who served time for embezzlement ten years ago and has been a contributing member of society ever since vs. an ex-felon who served time for aggravated battery, and has been in and out of jail for similar violent crimes over the past five years. </li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""6""><em>If possible, evaluate all other rental history, such as prior tenancies, employment, credit, income and affordability, before even going to the results of a criminal background check. </em>If the prospective tenant does not pass one or more of these other criteria, then the rejection can be based on that, rather than a criminal background report, thus avoiding the disparate impact issue entirely. </li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""7""><em>In evaluating an applicant's criminal history, do not use a ""one size fits all"" approach. </em>There are several gradations of severity.

The HUD Memo does not address this issue - so we don't know what the feds would say. Accordingly, it may be prudent to take a more balanced approach in these situations. For example, rather than having a blanket policy that a tenant will automatically be rejected if their charge is still pending, landlords and managers should evaluate the matter based upon (i) When the matter will be resolved, e.g. a week, a month, or a year? (ii) What was the charge? (iii) If convicted, would the applicant automatically be denied? As noted above, the whole issue of criminal background information is an element of the application process that need not be fully vetted, if, regardless of the crime, its severity or recency, the person would fail the application process <em>on other grounds.</em>If so, there is no need to rely upon a landlord's criminal background policy at all. However, a word of caution here: Be prudent when selecting a basis for denial. Using a weak reason can be viewed as pretextual if the applicant is a member of a protected class. In other words, beware of using a credit basis for denial if it is ""iffy"" and exclude the criminal background basis. In these cases, landlords and managers should consult legal counsel; it may be best to use both bases.  </li></ol><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">	<li value=""3"">ORS 90.303 says that a landlord may consider a conviction for certain conduct, generally relating to threats of violence, drugs, sex, or property damage, which would indicate risks to fellow tenants or the landlord. However, the HUD Memo is broader and more subtle (i.e. it demands an evaluation beyond a one-size-fits-all rejection policy). In short, do not rely solely on ORS 90.303, to the exclusion of the more balanced approach demanded by the Memo. </li></ol><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">	<li value=""4"">Unlike the HUD Memo, ORS 90.303 does not address how long ago the conviction occurred or require an evaluation of what the applicant had been doing since the conviction. (e. g. evidence of rehabilitation). In the past, earlier Landlord-Tenant Coalitions could not reach agreement on whether to use a five- or seven-year standard in the statute<sup>3</sup>, nor whether multiple convictions should be dealt with differently than single ones. Accordingly, our statute is silent on this issue.  </li></ol><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong><em>.  </em>Landlords could be forgiven for feeling they are caught on the horns of a dilemma. If they follow Oregon statutes, it may not be enough. And while it may be sufficient to follow federal law, today that requires a ""disparate impact"" analysis, which, at best, is a shifting and nuanced set of ""guidelines"" based upon anecdotal information.  </p><br><p>Perhaps most unsettling is the fact that today, a landlord's good faith effort to comply with the tenant application process is not enough. Instead, unintentional discrimination, now known under the more benign title, ""disparate impact"", has become a basis for Fair Housing claims. Yet unlike statutes, which can provide distinct guidance, disparate impact is more of a <em>concept</em>than a <em>law, </em>since it ignores one's intent, and looks instead to the perceived long-term consequences of certain actions based upon empirical statistics, academic writings, analysis, surveys, demographics and footnotes.

Based upon the above, it is my opinion that it would be improper to charge a ""move-in fee,"" unless it was designed to secure the execution of the rental agreement before the applicant took occupancy.

Do not hold onto them, as there is Oregon case law saying that doing so for an unreasonable amount of time can constitute acceptance. Include a letter with the checks reiterating what you told him about the necessity of the repairs and the need to sign the rental agreement. I hope the nature of the repairs and the amount of time he has to complete them are a part of the rental agreement. IF not they should be. The only real way to enforce this requirement is to make the repairs a written condition of the tenancy. Do not accept any rent from him unless and until the tenant has signed the rental agreement and it contains an explicit description of the work he is to do and a completion date. If he takes possession without having signed a written rental agreement, you may give him a 24-hour notice to terminate under ORS 90.403. The statute contemplates an improper subleasing arrangement which is not the case here. However, in all respects, it should work, since his possession is unauthorized and in possession without a signed rental agreement. Make sure that you use the proper form of notice, as this is not the same situation as giving a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct under ORS 90.396. Alternatively, if you have rules in the community that prohibit occupancy without a written rental agreement, you could issue a 30-day notice under ORS 90.630(1)(b).

Reasonable cause for rejection includes the failure of their references to respond to your request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection. If your rental application provides that it must be rejected within the 7-day statutory approval period (or it is deemed accepted), you may need to terminate first and then ask questions.  If you carry on a dialogue with the applicant and let the 7-day period expire without rejection, the law provides that you will have automatically accepted them.  So the best approach is to issue the rejection first and then find out the nature of the problem.  You can always rescind your rejection once you are satisfied.  Additionally, in the future, if you feel that the statutory 7-day period is too short, you may increase it, so long as the applicant agrees.  The 7-day statutory period only applies in the absence of the landlord and applicant agreeing to a longer time.  Subject to your attorney's approval, I suggest you consider inserting a provision in your applications expressly stating that the approval time will be 10, 12, or some other number of days that you feel is reasonably necessary.

I suspect that some folks may believe that by mailing their checks on the fourth (based upon the postmark), their rent payment is timely, i.e. no late charge will be assessed.  You want to make sure your residents understand that since they have the option of manually delivering their rent to the manager's office (or presumably dropping it into a box when the office is closed), that selecting the use of the mails requires that the rent is received - not simply deposited in a mailbox - could result in the assessment of a late charge if the check is received on the fifth or later.</p><br><p>Note, that <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.394"">ORS 90.394(4)</a> provides:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong>(4) </strong>Payment by a tenant who has received a (72-hour or 144 hour) notice *** is timely <em><u>if mailed to the landlord</u></em> within the period of the notice unless:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong>(a)</strong>The notice is served on the tenant:</p><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""><strong>(A)</strong>By personal delivery as provided in ORS <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.155""><strong>90.155</strong><strong>(Service or delivery of written notice)</strong></a> (1)(a); <strong>or</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""><strong>(B)</strong>By first class mail and attachment as provided in ORS<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.155""><strong>90.155</strong> <strong>(Service or delivery of written notice)</strong></a> (1)(c);</p><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""><strong>(b)</strong>A written rental agreement and the notice expressly state that payment is to be made at a specified location that is either on the premises or at a place where the tenant has made all previous rent payments in person; <strong>and</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""><strong>(c)</strong>The place so specified is available to the tenant for payment throughout the period of the notice. <em>(Underscored text in italics are mine.)</em></p><br><p>Although this statute does not expressly say that proof of mailing is determined by the postmark (and I have not researched this based upon Oregon case law), for purposes of the payment of  property taxes in Oregon, as well as state and federal income taxes, the postmark date is what is relied upon in determining whether the payment was timely.

The only exception might be if you had a specific provision in your Rental Agreement that expressly permitted it as a recoverable court cost.

If the resident, for example, asks to have a pit bull as an assistance animal, it is not altogether unreasonable, after vetting the dog's demeanor, socialization, etc., to propose another less aggressive animal as a ""reasonable accommodation."" </p><p>Third, for such breeds with known vicious propensities, you should check with your liability insurance carrier to see if they have a short list of animals <em><u>they will not insure</u></em> if there is an attack.  If the carrier says that animal is on that short list, then you should propose another less aggressive animal. In discussing this with the Fair Housing Council of Oregon while drafting the reasonable accommodation request portions of MHCO's form, they acknowledge the financial burden exception - however, suggested another step, i.e. finding an insurance carrier that would insure such aggressive animals if it was not overly expensive for the landlord to do so. I will leave extra step for discussion with your own attorney.</p><p>Then there are cases in which the request is clearly a ruse to get a pet approved as an assistance animal, when and it is clear to any reasonable person, it is a ruse.  You will have to decide on your own, or with the assistance of your attorney, how to proceed.  If, after giving the resident the MHCO form to complete, you are satisfied that it is a ruse, you are going to have to decide whether to call their bluff, or relent. If you relent, you will have done so only after requiring them to complete the necessary paperwork. However, be prepared for more copycats - pardon the pun.</p><h1>If you decide not to relent, and I've been involved in a few such cases, you have to be prepared for the next move.

I can envisage language that with the proper recitals and provisions, would give you more protection than you now have.  However, as we know, until the matter is litigated, you'll never know if the form is bullet-proof.

The HUD Memo does not address this issue - so we don't know what the feds would say. Accordingly, it may be prudent to take a more balanced approach in these situations. For example, rather than having a blanket policy that a tenant will automatically be rejected if their charge is still pending, landlords and managers should evaluate the matter based upon (i) When the matter will be resolved, e.g. a week, a month, or a year? (ii) What was the charge? (iii) If convicted, would the applicant automatically be denied? As noted above, the whole issue of criminal background information is an element of the application process that need not be fully vetted, if, regardless of the crime, its severity or recency, the person would fail the application process <em>on other grounds.</em> If so, there is no need to rely upon a landlord's criminal background policy at all. However, a word of caution here: Be prudent when selecting a basis for denial. Using a weak reason can be viewed as pretextual if the applicant is a member of a protected class. In other words, beware of using a credit basis for denial if it is ""iffy"" and exclude the criminal background basis. In these cases, landlords and managers should consult legal counsel; it may be best to use both bases.</li>	<li>ORS 90.303 says that a landlord may consider a conviction for certain conduct, generally relating to threats of violence, drugs, sex, or property damage, which would indicate risks to fellow tenants or the landlord. However, the HUD Memo is broader and more subtle (i.e. it demands an evaluation beyond a one-size-fits-all rejection policy). In short, do not rely solely on ORS 90.303, to the exclusion of the more balanced approach demanded by the Memo.</li>	<li>Unlike the HUD Memo, ORS 90.303 does not address how long ago the conviction occurred, or require an evaluation of what the applicant had been doing since the conviction.

ORS 90.532 (""Billing methods for utility or service charges"") provides that, subject to certain exceptions, landlords may provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of several alternative billing methods, depending upon the billing ""relationship"" between landlord and tenant: 1. A relationship between the tenant and the utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant's space, including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and the landlord does not act as a provider. 2. A relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord; the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant's space (or to a common area); and (a) the landlord: includes the cost of the utility or service in the tenant's rent; or (b) bills the tenant for the utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider's charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter. 3. And lastly, a relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord, the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant's space; and the landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually provided to the space and bills the tenant for a utility or service charge for the amount provided. It appears that No. 2(a) above may currently apply to your situation. In order to ""charge back"" the residents, I assume you mean charge them directly (outside the base rent) for the cost of the sewer service. Thus, what I understand you to be asking, is whether you can ""convert"" from 2(a) to 2(b). If your current sewer service is measured by water consumption, and your intent is to separately charge residents a pro rata basis calculated by a master water meter, then ORS 90.532(2(c) applies, which provides that a landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010. By your question, it appears that sewer and water are both included in base rent, at present. Thus, the prorata method (i.e. direct billing for sewer charges outside of base rent) would only be allowed if you already had it in place for all residents prior to January 1, 2010. Unfortunately, it appears that unless you begin submetering your water, you will be unable to separately charge for sewer on a prorata basis outside of your base rent.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1397088022,1402808401,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,347,"<p>Question: A tenant has her boyfriend living in her home under a MHCO Occupancy Agreement.

You are not allowed to screen for the occupant's ability to pay, because they are not a tenant. Your acceptance of rent from the occupant creates an appearance that the occupant is really a tenant. Secondly, the law says that a temporary occupant may not live in the home unless there is a tenant there as well. Accordingly, if you accept rent from the temporary occupant in the absence of the tenant living there, it could create a situation where you have waived the temporary occupant status, and are now treating him as a full time tenant. Here are the rules under the temporary occupancy statute ORS 90.275: - The temporary occupant: _ Is not a tenant entitled to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others; and _ Does not have the rights of a tenant. - The temporary occupancy agreement may be terminated by: _ The tenant without cause at any time; and _ The landlord only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement. - The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure a violation that causes a landlord to terminate the temporary occupancy agreement. - Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, a landlord may screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record. The landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level. - A temporary occupancy agreement: _ Must expressly include the above requirements; _ May provide that the temporary occupant is required to comply with any applicable rules for the premises; and _ May have a specific ending date. - The landlord, tenant and temporary occupant may extend or renew a temporary occupancy agreement or may enter into a new temporary occupancy agreement. - A landlord or tenant is not required to give the temporary occupant written notice of the termination of a temporary occupancy agreement. - The temporary occupant shall promptly vacate the dwelling unit if a landlord terminates a temporary occupancy agreement for material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement or if the temporary occupancy agreement ends by its terms. _ Except in cases of discrimination (ORS 90.449) a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the tenant if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate or if the tenant materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement. - A temporary occupant is treated as a squatter if they continue to occupy the home after a tenancy has ended or after the tenant revokes permission for the occupancy by terminating the temporary occupancy agreement. - A landlord may not enter into a temporary occupancy agreement for the purpose of evading landlord responsibilities; - A tenant may not become a temporary occupant in the tenant's own dwelling unit; - A tenancy may not consist solely of a temporary occupancy. Each tenancy must have at least one tenant. In your case, it would appear that you could either terminate the tenant's tenancy since they vacated leaving the temporary occupant to occupy alone, a violation of the statute, or terminate the temporary occupant for the same reason. I would try a written notice to the temporary occupant, to see if they will voluntarily vacate. If they refuse, then you should retain counsel and proceed to evict him as a squatter. Do not, under any circumstances, accept rent from the temporary occupant.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1370367235,1402810325,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12826,"<p>Question: When residents want to place their home on the market, we tell them we have a preferred real estate agent we want them to use.

(1) A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if: - The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and - There exists a written rental agreement that specifies: _ The tenant's obligation to pay a late charge; _ The type and amount of the late charge; and _ The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due. (2) The amount of any late charge may not exceed: - A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. ""Reasonable amount"" means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market; - A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the ""reasonable flat amount"", described above; or - Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. (3) In periodic tenancies [e.g. month-to-month], a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days' written notice to the tenant. (4) A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment. (5) A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed. (6) Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination. [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1398266036,1402809711,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13226,"<br><p><strong>Question: </strong> We have a 91 year old tenant who is bedridden, and his daughter who is 66 years old, is his caretaker.

You can't automatically say, ""OK, you <em><u>must</u></em> go on an Occupancy Agreement.""  <em>[Caveat: I do not agree with this position, and do not endorse it. The consequences of putting a caregiver on a rental agreement is that you have an much stricter protocol when they violate the rules or laws - e.g. written notice and opportunity to cure, etc. I believe that caregivers and others who are there on a temporary arrangement should remain on the Temporary Occupancy Agreement.

There are several statutes that come into play:</p><br><p><strong>90.514 Disclosure to prospective tenant of improvements required under rental agreement.</strong> </p><br><p>(1) Before a prospective tenant signs a rental agreement for space in a manufactured dwelling park or for a converted rental space, the landlord must provide the prospective tenant with a written statement that discloses the improvements that the landlord will require under the rental agreement. The written statement must be in the format developed by the Attorney General pursuant to ORS 90.516 and include at least the following:</p><p>      (c) <em><u>Identification of the improvements that belong to the tenant and the improvements that must remain with the space</u></em>.</p><br><p><strong>90.730 </strong><strong>Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.</strong></p><br><p>(7)  The landlord and tenant may agree in writing that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks and minor remodeling only if:</p><p>      (a) The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord;</p><p>      (b) The agreement does not diminish the obligations of the landlord to other tenants on the premises; and</p><p>      (c) The terms and conditions of the agreement are clearly and fairly disclosed and adequate consideration for the agreement is specifically stated.</p><br><p><strong> 90.740 Tenant obligations.</strong> A tenant shall:</p><p>      (1) Install the tenant's manufactured dwelling or floating home <em><u>and any accessory building or structure</u></em> on a rented space in compliance with applicable laws and the rental agreement.</p><br><p>In summary, what these statutes, and other in ORS Chapter 90 mean, is the following:</p><ul>	<li>When the landlord rents a space, it includes all pre-existing structures located on the space, such as carports and sheds.</li>	<li>Does this mean the carport or shed must be maintained by the resident? In my opinion, not unless the rental agreement or rules provide otherwise. And if they so provide, it must be clearly disclosed at the commencement of the tenancy. If the roof leaked and the resident's belongings were damaged, the landlord could have liability.</li>	<li>If a landlord wanted to transfer ownership of the carport or shed, the arrangement should be clearly documented, including the duty to maintain, and the right to remove upon vacating the space.</li>	<li>In terms of a ""downside"" I see very little so long as the responsibility going forward is clear; on the other hand, I see a ""downside"" in doing nothing, and then each side expects the duty of maintenance belongs to the other - and as pointed out above, if the structure leaks or has a fire, etc., the landlord could have liability.</li>	<li>When a space changes hands, and you want to transfer the maintenance responsibility at that time, you can do so, as long as it's clear and fair. You cannot, for example, require that a shed that has maintenance problems, be rebuilt or be repainted.</li>	<li>On the issue of reducing the rent, ORS 90.730(7), cited above, does refer to adequate consideration if the maintenance responsibility is shifted from the landlord to the resident.  That may be true where you don't transfer ownership of the structure to the resident. But if you do transfer ownership, and the resident, that is adequate consideration (in my opinion), so long as it is in good condition, and the arrangement was not done solely to avoid having to perform repairs.  I would want to make sure that the structure was in good condition at the time, fully inspected by the resident, and the transaction clearly documented.</li>	<li>As for the sharing of carports, one owned and the other not, it would be nice to get clarity on this between the two residents. The same rules apply, i.e. if the structure is in good repair, and the non-owner is willing to take ownership and assume maintenance responsibility, it would be better than what you have right now. As it stands, you, technically, have maintenance responsibility for the portion of the structure that is park-owned. This likely makes for confusion when repairs, such as roofing and painting are required.</li></ul>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1455213019,1455213048,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12768,"<p>Question.

The term ""submeter"" is used for any meter installed after the master meter. With submeters installed at every mobile home the association is able to utilize a third party meter reading and billing company to read the meters and produce monthly bills for the selected utilities.</p>",963,997,1580,15990,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Changing Screening Criteria,"<p>Why Submeter?</p><p>One of the largest expenses for a mobile home park is utilities. It is also an expense item that continues to increase over time. There are three major reasons for this:</p><p>- Rate Increases - The cost of energy (gas and electric) production and acquiring clean water has outpaced inflation for the past decade.</p><p>- Increases in Occupancy - Due to the economic environment more people are living with extended families. Higher occupancy leads to higher utility usage.</p><p>- Wasteful Usage - Residents are often less conservative with their utility usage when they are not aware of their individual consumption or do not have an incentive to save.</p><p>Studies have shown that once residents become aware of their utility usage, the total consumption will go down, on average around 22%. According to a 2007 Santa Clara Water District study, Water Submetering in Mobile Home Parks, ""Tenants who are individually metered can benefit by being able to monitor and control their water use - with submetering, they only pay for what they use, not what others use . . . the four mobile home parks examined shows an annual water savings of from 15 to 30%.""</p><p>Submetering makes economic sense for both the association and the residents. The water, gas and/or electric can be billed back to the residents thus reducing the overall association's expenses. Without submetering, associations and property owners may be forced to pass the increased expenses evenly to all residents. This would unfairly increase costs for residents who are already conscious of their utility usage. The residents will benefit because they are now in control of their utility expenses.</p><p>Submeters and Automatic Meter Reading Systems (AMR)</p><p>There are many types of submeters that will accommodate any mobile home. In areas where water pipes can freeze, you need to take measures to prevent the meters from freezing. For these applications there are meters with freeze plates or heat tape with insulation jackets. There are also a variety of gas and electric meters suitable for any environment. Submeters were once read by a ""meter reader"" who came to the property once a month to read the meters either manually or with a variety of handheld devices. This outdated way of reading meters only provided the meter readings once a month, so if there were a leak on the property or a running toilet, hundreds of gallons of water would have already been wasted before the resident received their next bill. The current way of reading submeters is through an Automatic Meter Reading System or (AMR). AMR's have a small transmitter connected to each meter that sends the meter reads wirelessly to a data collector located on the property. The meter readings can then be downloaded daily and used to notify a property manager or resident if there is a sudden or steady increase in water usage. The devices can pinpoint the exact meter and time the increased usage started so the leak can be resolved within days, not months. Many submetering and billing companies can provide a web-based system with daily meter reads with their services.</p><p>How does it Work?</p><p>It is best to select a reputable submetering and billing company in the beginning to ensure you are getting the appropriate meters and AMR system for your property. These companies will typically handle all of the details, from the design and installation to the resident billing so you can start saving immediately. Following are some typical steps for a new installation:</p><p>1. A complete property analysis is completed to determine the best submetering products for the desired application.</p><p>2. Notices are issued to inform residents of the new submetering system.</p><p>3. Equipment is ordered and depending on state and local regulations may be sent to a government office for inspection and testing. The meters would then be installed along with the AMR system.</p><p>4. Resident information along with their meters is uploaded to a billing system and ready for processing.</p><p>5. Meter information is read via (AMR) wireless transmitters and receivers and transmitted back to a billing company. Individual meter readings are then imported into a billing system and individual utility bills are created.</p><p>6. Utility bills are sent directly to residents via U.S. Mail and/or electronically to e-mail addresses.</p><p>7. The billing company will typically collects payments via multiple payment methods including check, money order, eCheck or major credit card. Online and phone payments are often accepted as well.</p><p>8.

In other words, at the time of submetering the spaces, you could do it using the prorate method you describe, in which case it would be preceded by a 180-day notice. See, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.537"">ORS 90.537</a>. It provides:</p><br><p>A landlord that converts to a submeter billing method under this section from the rent billing method described in ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.532"">90.532 (Billing methods for utility or service charges)</a> (1)(b)(C)(i) <em><u>may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters</u></em>, convert the billing for common areas to the pro rata billing method described in ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.532"">90.532 </a>(1)(b)(C)(ii) (Billing methods for utility or service charges) by including the change in the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. </p><br><p>However, the balance of this subsection provides that ""(i)f the landlord continues to use the rent billing method for common areas, the landlord may offset against the rent reduction [that was a part of the pass-through conversion] an amount that reflects the cost of serving the common areas.""</p><br><p>If your utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, this subsection allow you to ""...assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed. However, this offset is not available if you choose to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method.</p><br><p>Your question raises the issue whether you may now convert the common area costs from the base rent to submetering. Here are your choices as I see them, keeping in mind you should vet this issue with your own lawyer:</p><br><ul>	<li>Convert to submetering solely for the common area, following the same protocol as you did at the time of converting the spaces.  However, this will require you to know with some certainty the actual cost of sewer and water to the common areas. However, this approach is not expressly described in the statutes.</li>	<li>Forego submetering  - as you have done - and check with your utility provider to see if you can obtain an accurate cost for the common area service, and follow the same rent reduction and notice protocol under ORS 90.537, as if you were converting to submeters. If so, you could use the prorate apportionment as you propose. This would also require a ""unilateral amendment"" of the rental agreements. The only legal objection to this would be that it was not at the same time you converted the spaces to submetering.</li>	<li>If your provider cannot provide an accurate cost, you could make the 20% offset assumption against the rent reduction taken when you first converted to submetering the spaces. You would follow the same unilateral amendment, and 180-day notice as the alternative above.  I acknowledge that this offset is subject to distortion, since the 20% is against a rent reduction in the past. There may be an equitable way to arrive at a figure, but it would likely require some consensus of the residents.</li></ul><br><p><em>Caveat:  </em>All of these protocols are based upon following ORS 90.537(5) <em><u>as if </u></em>they were occurring at the time of submetering the spaces.  Since the statute does not expressly address common area conversion separate from the process when converting to submeters for the space, there is always the argument that it simply is not permitted. That is why I think you will need tenant buy-in. Or you could do it through a rule change, which would likely be safer than a ""unilateral amendment"".

This is done by giving written notice of the proposed rule change, and unless residents of at least 51 percent of the eligible spaces in the facility object in writing within 30 days of the date the notice was served, the change shall become effective for all residents of those spaces on a date not less than 60 days after the date that the notice was served by the landlord.</p><br><p>One resident per eligible space may object to the rule change through either:</p><ul>	<li>A signed and dated written communication to the landlord; or</li>	<li>A petition format that is signed and dated by residents of eligible spaces and that includes a copy of the proposed rule or regulation and a copy of the notice.</li></ul><br><p>If a resident of an eligible space signs both a written communication to the landlord and a petition, or signs more than one written communication or petition, only the latest signature of the resident may be counted.</p><br><p>A proxy may be used only if a resident has a disability that prevents the resident from objecting to the rule or regulation change in writing.</p><br><p>The landlord's notice of a proposed rule change must be given in the same manner as other notices. See, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.155""><strong>ORS 90.155</strong> <strong>(Service or delivery of written notice)</strong></a> and must include:</p><ul>	<li>Language of the existing rule or regulation and the language that would be added or deleted by the proposed rule or regulation change; and</li>	<li>A statement substantially following the text set forth in subsection 90.610(7)(b)in the following form, with all blank spaces in the notice to be filled in by the landlord:</li></ul><br><p>Unless residents of at least 51 percent of the eligible spaces object, the proposed rule will go into effect on a date that is at least 60 days <em><u>plus</u> three additional days, if mailed regular first class mail</em>, from the date of mailing.</p><br><p>There are additional provisions of the statute, so owners and managers contemplating a rule change should become familiar with all of them.</p><br><p><strong><em>Changes to the Statement of Policy.  </em></strong>Every landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling (or floating home) is required to provide a written statement of policy to prospective and existing residents. The purpose of the statement of policy is to provide disclosure of the landlord's policies to prospective residents and to existing residents <em>who have not previously received a statement of policy</em>. The statement of policy is <u>not</u> a part of the rental agreement.</p><br><p>The statement of policy must contain the following information in summary form:</p><ul>	<li>The location and approximate size of the space to be rented.</li>	<li>The federal fair-housing age classification and present zoning that affect the use of the rented space.</li>	<li>The community policy regarding rent adjustment and a rent history for the space to be rented. The rent history must, at a minimum, show the rent amounts on January 1 of each of the five preceding calendar years or during the length of the landlord's ownership, leasing or subleasing of the facility, whichever period is shorter.</li>	<li>The personal property, services and facilities that are provided by the landlord.</li>	<li>The installation charges that are imposed by the landlord and the installation fees that are imposed by government agencies.</li>	<li>The community policy regarding rental agreement termination including, but not limited to, park closure.</li>	<li>The community policy regarding on-site sales.</li>	<li>The community policy regarding informal dispute resolution.</li>	<li>The utilities and services that are available, the name of the person furnishing them and the name of the person responsible for payment.</li>	<li>If a residents association exists, a one-page summary about the association. The residents association is required to provide the summary to the landlord.</li>	<li>Any community policy requiring removal of a home, including a statement that removal requirements may impact the market value of a home.</li>	<li>Any facility policy regarding the planting of trees on the rented space.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><p>The rental agreement and rules and regulations are required to be attached as an exhibit to the statement of policy. If the recipient of the statement of policy is an existing resident, the rental agreement attached to the statement of policy must be a copy of the one entered by the landlord and resident.</p><br><p>Here are the delivery requirements:</p><br><ul>	<li>Landlords are required to give <em>prospective residents</em> a copy of the statement of policy <em>before</em> the residents sign their rental agreement.</li>	<li><em>Existing residents</em> who have not previously received a copy of the statement of policy and who are on month-to-month rental agreements must receive a copy of the statement of policy at the time of a 90-day notice of a rent increase is issued.</li>	<li><em>All other existing residents</em> who have not previously received a copy of the statement of policy, a copy of the statement of policy upon the expiration of their rental agreements and before the residents sign new agreements.<em> [Note: This provision refers to residents on fixed term leases.]</em></li></ul><p>As you can see from the above discussion, the statement of policy statute makes no provision for amendment or change.  That isn'tto say it cannot be changed, however.  Assuming that your statement of policy only addresses the required policies listed above, it would be my suggestion that if one or more of those policies change, you should change your statement of policy accordingly, and reissue it to all of the residents. </p><br><p>For example, assume that your community has held itself out as a family park under federal and state fair housing laws, but in fact, could qualify under the 80% rule as a 55+ park.  Under certain circumstances, by a rule change, it could convert to a 55+ community. In that case, you would want to change your statement of policy accordingly.</p><br><p>As for other changes, either due to Oregon law, or rule changes, if they are not on the required list of items to be addressed in the statement of policy, I see no reason to change the existing statement of policy.  However, if your statement of policy addresses additional items, and one or more of them are impacted by a change in Oregon law or the community rules, I would recommend amending your statement of policy accordingly.</p><br><p><strong><em>Changes to the Rental Agreement or Lease.</em></strong> Pursuant to ORS 90.510(4) landlords are required to provide a written rental agreement to their residents.  It must be signed by the landlord and resident and <em><u>may not be unilaterally amended</u></em> by one of the parties to the contract except by:</p><ul>	<li>Mutual agreement of the parties;</li>	<li>Actions taken pursuant to ORS <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.530"">90.530 (Pets in facilities)</a>,<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.533"">90.533 (Conversion of billing method for garbage collection and disposal)</a>, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.537"">90.537 (Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges)</a>, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.543"">90.543 (Utility or service charge billing for large manufactured dwelling parks)</a> (3), <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.600"">90.600 (Increases in rent)</a>, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.725"">90.725 (Landlord or agent access to rented space)</a> (3)(f) and (7) or <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.727"">90.727(Maintenance of trees in rented spaces)</a>; or</li>	<li>Those provisions required by changes in statute or ordinance.</li></ul><br><p>The rental agreement must specify:</p><ul>	<li>The location and approximate size of the rented space;</li>	<li>The federal fair-housing age classification;</li>	<li>The rent per month;</li>	<li>All personal property, services and facilities to be provided by the landlord;</li>	<li>All security deposits, fees and installation charges imposed by the landlord;</li>	<li>Any community policy regarding the planting of trees on the rented space;</li>	<li>Improvements that the resident may or must make to the rental space, including plant materials and landscaping;</li>	<li>Provisions for dealing with improvements to the rental space at the termination of the tenancy;</li>	<li>Any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser of a home as a resident in the event the resident elects to sell the home.

Clearly, you may do so, if required by statute or ordinance. For the past several years, most changes to Oregon's manufactured housing rental laws, provide whether the rental agreement may be ‰ÛÏunilaterally amended‰Ûù to accommodate the change.</p><br><p>Note that under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.545"">ORS 90.545</a>, Oregon law allows ‰ÛÏfixed term tenancies‰Ûù i.e. leases.  Under this law, it is much easier to change all three of the community documents.  Although leases may be not less than two years, at least 60 days prior to the end of the term, the landlord may give the resident a new set of community documents. Although there are certain restrictions found at subsection (3), they are not onerous.  Essentially, you are permitted to give existing residents on lease the same documents as you are currently giving new residents.  You do not have to follow the rule change statute, and do not need permission from the resident to change their rental agreement. The same thing applies to the statement of policy.  It is for this reason that I am a proponent of short term, e.g. two to five year leases; they allow landlords to update their community documents as the laws and regulations change.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1432054100,1534198260,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,305,"<p>Question. A resident of our community has asked for a list of all the other residents' names and addresses, so that she can contact them to set up a homeowners association. While I don't have an objection to the formation of a tenant association, I am concerned that giving out residents' names and addresses might violate some tenant rights on our part. Can you help?</p>",963,997,1580,15765,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Community Owner Providing Tenant Association Information on Residents,"<p>Answer: ORS Chapter 90, the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act, is replete with references to tenant associations. Residents clearly have many rights when it comes to the formation of an association, including the right of assembly and the right to canvass other residents. However, nowhere does the law say that park owners and managers have a legal duty to provide individual contact information to other residents, regardless of the purpose for which it is sought. Here is what ORS 90.750 [""Right to assemble or canvass in facility; limitations""] says on the matter: - No park bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule shall infringe upon resident rights to: _ Peaceably assemble in an open public meeting for any lawful purpose, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the common areas or recreational areas; reasonable times are the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. _ To communicate or assemble among themselves, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of discussing any matter, including but not limited to any matter relating to the park, or manufactured dwelling living. - The discussions may be held in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility, including halls or centers, or any resident's home. - However, the landlord may enforce reasonable rules and regulations including but not limited to place, scheduling, occupancy densities and utilities. - A landlord may not prohibit any resident from canvassing other persons in the same facility for certain prescribed purposes. The term ""canvassing"" includes door-to-door contact, an oral or written request, the distribution, circulation, posting or publication of a notice or newsletter, a general announcement or any other matter relevant to the membership of a tenants' association. - However, a landlord is not required to permit any person to solicit money, except that a tenants' association member, whether or not a tenant of the facility, may personally collect delinquent dues owed by an existing member of a tenants' association. - Lastly, the statute clarifies that it is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to disregard a tenant's request not to be canvassed. To me, this last provision suggests an answer to your question, as it acknowledges that some residents may not want to be ""canvassed."" In other words, they have certain rights not to be disturbed, and may request management's assistance in preventing it from occurring. Accordingly, my view is that before contact information is shared by management with other residents, advance consent should be received from each affected person. Without such consent, I would be very hesitant to give out the information. Certainly, the resident seeking the contact information can try to obtain it by going door-to-door and asking for it. If community management already maintains a published directory of residents that contains names and addresses, I suppose consent is implied by the lapse of time, assuming that everyone knows of the directory. But I would not recommend this practice, and certainly would not share the information with other residents. My conclusions are based not so much on some legal duty of ""confidentiality"" or legally protectable ""right of privacy."" With the Internet, it's hard to say much of our private information is legally protectable any more. My feeling is a practical one: If there is no affirmative legal duty to provide the information, and there is some risk, however remote, that sharing it without advance consent could anger some residents, it is far better to decline your resident's request. It does not hamper the association formation process in any way, and respects every resident's privacy, however limited it is today.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1354553335,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13381,"<br><p><strong>Question. </strong>My first question deals with ORS 90.533 which provides:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong> 90.533 Conversion of billing method for garbage collection and disposal.</strong> (1) A landlord may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert the method of billing a tenant for garbage collection and disposal from a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b) to a method in which the service provider:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (a) Supplies garbage receptacles;</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (b) Collects and disposes of garbage; and</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (c)(A) Bills the tenant directly; or</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (B) Bills the landlord, who then bills the tenant based upon the number and size of the receptacles used by the tenant.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (2) A landlord shall give a tenant not less than 180 days' written notice before converting a billing method under subsection (1) of this section.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">      (3) If the cost of garbage service was included in the rent before the conversion of a billing method under subsection (1) of this section, the landlord shall reduce the tenant's rent upon the first billing of the tenant under the new billing method.

Effectively passing on what we are charged for their individual use?</p>",963,997,1580,15759,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Converting Water Systems and Billing (Well Water to Public System),"<p>Answer: For purpose of addressing this issue, I will assume that the community currently includes the operating costs for the well in the base rent, i.e. it is not a charge to residents outside of base rent that is allocated to them on a prorata (i.e. per space) basis. Well water is not something you may separately charge the residents for under ORS 90.532. There is no recognized method under Oregon law to recover it separately from - or outside of - base rent. Since base rent may only be increased in accordance with the 90-day rent raise protocol described in ORS 90.600, there is no pass-through alternative for communities serviced by well water for drinking. Subsection (8) of ORS 90.532 limits utility charges for water through the following means: A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a: (a) Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005; (b) Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225; (c) People's utility district organized under ORS chapter 261; (d) Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62; (e) Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or (f) Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552. (9) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757. Your question does not indicate whether the new water system falls into one of the above categories. If it does, then you are entitled to assess a pass-through protocol, so long as the other submetering statutes are followed What follows is brief summary of the applicable statutes. As you will see, the issues are technical and complex. In short, you should secure competent legal advice from an expert familiar with your particular situation. This article or summary should not be relied upon to the exclusion of obtaining that legal advice. - 90.532 This statute sets forth the permissible billing methods park owners may use for their water charges. - 90.534 This statute describes how a landlord may charge for providing a utility or service directly to the residents' spaces by apportionment of the costs per space. - 90.536 This statute describes the use of submeters to each space and the appropriate billing method. - 90.537 This statute instructs landlords on how and when they may convert from one billing method to another. - 90.538 This statute describes the tenants' rights to inspect billing records when an owner converts from one billing system to another. In your case, since you are on well water, the only records I imagine you would have would be the well water maintenance costs, since there is no direct water charge to you. - 90.539 This statute describes the park owner's rights to access a resident's space to read the submeter. Conclusion. Without knowing more, it is hard to say definitively whether your proposed billing method [assuming the system is permissible under ORS 90.532(8)], would be allowed. However, my guess is that it is not. The reason is that the legislation and legislative history that resulted in these statutes is based upon much discussion and anecdotal experience. The categories and protocols are very specific. If you were to submeter, I suspect you could not ""blend"" your charges to include the equivalent of a fixed fee for everyone, with a metered rate for the higher users. The concept behind submetering is that everyone pays for exactly what they use - no more, no less. You proposed system does not appear to do that. Additionally, I do not believe you may ""convert"" to this new system without making some downward adjustment in base rent, to account for the fact that the residents will no longer be using the well water - and therefore should no longer be paying the well maintenance cost. [Of course, if the well water were converted to irrigation, that cost - already in the base rent - would seemingly be permissible.]</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1368559525,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13253,"<p><strong>Question: </strong>A home was purchased by a local dealer from a resident who had not paid rent for several months.

However, as long as the home remains on the space, the landlord has complete control over the situation.

The written summary to dealers should clearly state that if a departing tenant owes monies to the landlord, repayment will be required before occupancy of the home will be permitted by a new resident.  <em>[A more difficult question that is not addressed by the statute, ORS 90.680, is whether the landlord may prevent the dealer from removing the home without paying the past due sums.

Set forth below is a summary of those portions of the statute that address your questions:</p><br><ul>	<li>If the prospective purchaser of a manufactured dwelling or floating home desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, the landlord may require the following:	<ul>		<li>That a tenant give not more than 10 days' notice in writing prior to the sale of the dwelling or home on a rented space;</li>		<li>That prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized;</li>		<li>That a prospective purchaser may not occupy the dwelling or home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;</li>		<li>That a tenant give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser <em><u>or person licensed to sell dwellings or homes</u></em> of the requirements of the resale requirements <em>[Emphasis mine - PCQ]</em>;</li>		<li>If the sale is not by a lienholder, that the prospective purchaser pay in full <em><u>all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant</u></em> prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant [Emphasis mine];</li>	</ul>	</li>	<li>If the landlord's rules and/or rental agreement requires prospective purchasers to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>;    </li>	<li>The following conditions apply if a landlord receives an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser:	<ul>		<li> The landlord shall accept or reject the prospective purchaser's application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>;</li>		<li>An application is not complete until the prospective purchaser pays any required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required by the landlord;</li>	</ul>	</li>	<li>The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to:	<ul>		<li>Failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlord's conditions for approval;</li>		<li>Failure of the prospective purchaser's references to respond to the landlord's timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection;</li>		<li>In most cases, the landlord must furnish to the seller and purchaser a written statement of the reasons for any rejection<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>;</li>	</ul>	</li>	<li>The landlord may give the tenant selling the home a notice to repair the home [e.g. for damage or deterioration] under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.632"">ORS 90.632</a>. The landlord may also give any prospective purchaser a copy of that notice.	<ul>		<li>The landlord may require as a condition of tenancy that a prospective purchaser who desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant must comply with the repair notice within the allowed period under ORS 90.632.</li>		<li>If the tenancy has been terminated for failure to timely complete the repairs under ORS 90.632, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.</li>	</ul>	</li></ul><p>Obviously, the statute was drafted with tenant/purchasers in mind.  However, as long as the home remains on the space, the landlord has complete control over the situation.  In your case, I suspect the delinquent tenant made no effort to notify the landlord of his planned sale to the dealer.  However, that does not prevent him from imposing these requirements on the dealer if he wants to put a tenant in the park.</p><br><p>Going forward, it might be advisable for all landlords who have faced this situation before, to prepare a summary of requirements to give dealers when they purchase homes from tenants already sited in the park.  They may want to expressly address this in their rules, so tenants cannot say they didn'tknow.  The written summary to dealers should clearly state that if a departing tenant owes monies to the landlord, repayment will be required before occupancy of the home will be permitted by a new resident.  <em>[A more difficult question that is not addressed by the statute, ORS 90.680, is whether the landlord may prevent the dealer from removing the home without paying the past due sums.  I suspect the answer may be ""Yes"" a landlord may do so, but it would require my examination of the statutory storage or retaining lien rights, which is beyond the scope of this question. - PCQ]  </em></p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> The terms of the statement of policy, rental agreement and rules and regulations need not be the same as those in the selling tenant's statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> The landlord and the prospective purchaser may agree to a longer time period beyond seven day for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.

This is particularly true in 55+ communities. To be great at resident retention, managers need to believe strongly in the lifestyle that has led many seniors to a manufactured housing way of life. Managers must be helpful, respectful, enthusiastic and work relentlessly to continuously improve their seniors' lifestyles.</p>",963,997,1580,15997,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Dealing With A Convicted Sex Offender In The Community,"<p>One of the measuring sticks of great managers, as well as great regional managers, is their ability to be friendly while at the same time, keeping their eyes firmly upon the objectives of the community. The responsibilities of property management are immense and sometimes thankless. It is hard to believe that any of us could add another thing to our schedules to strive for better resident relations. But we must, and we must go at it with an eager, devoted, and intense passion to be successful. The only way to achieve this and still maintain the quality of the community is great organizational skills, resident, participation and the initiative to be creative.</p><p>No matter how large or small a community and its budget, the following simple steps will bring a community to its peak performance and create strong resident relations.</p><p>Get the Residents Involved</p><p>Make photo albums or scrapbooks of residents enjoying their community or community activities. Seniors enjoy donating photos from their past and the fun time they've had with neighbors or friends. Residents can form a photography club to take pictures of all community events, funny resident situations and neighbors helping one another. Photo clubs are a good source for pictures submitted by residents. Volunteers can help with the collection of photos and putting together the album. Display the album(s) proudly in the activity center or community lounge area for all to enjoy. Managers should look through the books from time to time to ensure quality content.</p><p>Encourage residents to write positive letters or stories about the community. Resident writings can be collected in an attractive album, which is also to be displayed in the community activity center. When the letters have been submitted, ask if they may be used in the community newsletter. Pick one letter a month to exhibit in an attractive picture frame under the caption, ""Letter of the month"" or ""Why we enjoy living in this community.""</p><p>Create a journal to pass around the community (it may be a spiral notebook) for all residents to write in. A note stating the topic should be firmly attached on the outside of the journal for all to read before inserting thoughts. The note may ask for how long the resident has lived in the community and a short biography. Encourage the use of photos or themselves, their families and/or pets. The final instruction should be ""When you are finished with your thoughts, please pass this on to your neighbor. If you do not wish to be a part of this project, please call the community office, and we will pick it up."" The notebook should be placed inside a weatherproof cover and given to the first home in the community. Many 55+ communities have seasonal residents. You might want to wait to start until they return, so all may participate.</p><p>If your community activity center has a television set and VCR, you can host movie matinees on adverse weather days. Rent a latest release (within the confines of movies seniors love), make popcorn for all (no salt or butter) and offer a non alcoholic beverage. Make sure the television is placed where everyone may comfortably view it, such as a stage as or the center of the room, and make the viewing room dark. What other thoughtful task can one do for less than $20 that gives joy to so many residents?</p><p>Everyone loves to show off their pets, especially seniors. Host a pet show. Purchase certificates and first, second, third place ribbons to award. Volunteers may acquire donations from local pet stores or other businesses to be awarded as prizes. Use an outside volunteer to pick the winners based on show, grooming, posture and training. Participants of local pet shows may be willing to volunteer their time to judge.</p><p>The same idea can work for a car show. Many residents have classic cars of which they are very proud. You may want to look in your local auto trader magazines for people who host car shows professionally. Many communities are looking for locations to hold their shows, complete with DJs, prizes, emcees and media. Use the same ideas from the pet show for great results.</p><p>Consider opening your clubhouse to local hobbyists. Most cities have model train clubs, remote-control airplane clubs, coin collectors and other hobbyists who are always looking for new places to meet and show off their labors of love. This effort provides seniors a pathway back to their childhood.</p><p>Keep yourself involved</p><p>In 55+ communities, residents are more interested in local government and have the time to help coordinate and change issues of concern. Some merely need the leadership and backing of the property owners or managers and the knowledge of who to contact to start the ball rolling. Cooperation of managers and residents can create great things and bond them together for the common good of everyone.</p><p>Perhaps the very best resident relations trick is getting outside the comfortable walls of the community to make changes that affect all the residents. If there are local or state issues of concern to manufactured housing communities or their residents, they need to get involved. Our government works for us, and is more likely to listen than it is often credited as being. One method toward such change is finding a government official who truly cares or is up for election. Their voters live in our communities. Working with the government takes patience and dedication. Although this kind of dedication may be very time consuming, in 55+ communities it is just as valuable as anything else a property manager does.</p><p>Start by reading every government mailing received. Items come up for vote on a regular basis that often negatively affect seniors and are addressed in a public forum prior to election. These forums are great opportunities for retirees and managers to give input toward change. Retired residents have the knowledge, spirit and time to investigate, preparing everything it takes to help present ideas in public forums.</p><p>Read all the fine print on every utility bill. Rates may increase and go unnoticed. If the utility companies are approached when proposing these changes, very often they may be overturned. It is not hard to present options to officials devising change. For example, in 1992 the managers of a small senior community discovered the water department offered water-leak rebates for site-built homes, but did not offer any solution to water leaks in manufactured housing communities with master meters sub-metered by the community.</p><p>With little effort this issue was approached, and the property managers found the city water department to be very cooperative in helping to resolve this problem. Today, a program is in place for all the residents in the city under these conditions, to receive rebates when residents have water leaks.</p><p>The same situation happened in a large Florida county. Residents in mater-metered communities also could not receive water leak rebates. Given the equation for determining sewer rates, when residents had leaks, the charges were exorbitant. This seriously affected the fixed-income seniors in the county. In 2000, because of a cooperative effort between water department, community management, and the homeowner's association of a 55+ community, this oversight was resolved. The effort only took a few phone calls, two meetings, a couple of faxes and the designing of a form that would work for the county and the community. Within 30 days of the community's first request, a program was in place for the entire county making it possible for all residents to receive rebates on water leaks.</p><p>In 1997, a county water department implemented an ideal way to dispose of waste water by a unique filtering system, then piped the filtered water throughout the county to be used for irrigation (reclaimed water). The process cost the county millions of dollars in construction. The county water department proposed a lengthy, complicated billing system to its customers, in the form of a ""base rate."" The proposed rate would have a devastating effect to senior residents in manufactured housing communities under the same metering conditions as described above because the master-metered system is considered ""commercial"".</p><p>Many phone calls were made by two community managers, in an attempt to find someone in the water department willing to explain the complex proposal, and willing to work with the communities to lower the billing rate. This six-month process required many meetings with the water department and a dedicated effort to get all the affected communities involved in the process. Today, as a result of this effort, all of the manufactured housing communities in that county now have a new category for billing commercial at residential rates. This new category lowered residents' base rate more than half of the original proposed increase. This lower rate was a big help to set-income seniors.</p><p>Keeping the media involved</p><p>Local TV media and newspaper reporters are always looking for human-interest stories. Every time a manager discovers a resident who has done something extraordinary, the media needs to be alerted. This includes Senior Olympics medalists, golfers who shot holes in one, shuffleboard champions and bowlers with a 300 game or a high series. Press releases should be sent to local papers to thank residents for special things they do in the form of ""Volunteer of the Month"" or ""Hero of the Month."" You might also want to invite the media to special events, such as National Night Out or other unique activities. Not only does the media coverage give residents a terrific boost, it is the best free advertising available.</p><p>These ideas and the examples above prove dedication and cooperative efforts between managers, residents, government officials and media to preserve and enhance the lifestyle seniors worked tirelessly to earn. What better way to thank the people who shaped our world, than to work passionately to help preserve the lifestyle for which they worked so hard. Home is where they should feel safe, respected, cared for and appreciated. Home is what we are to provide.</p><p>Reprinted from MHCO ""Community Management""</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1412261887,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13042,"<br><p><strong><em>Question. </em></strong>We have a problem and I'm looking for guidance as to the proper way to handle it.

Can you point me in the right direction?</p><p><strong><em>Answer.</em></strong> First, I will assume that you have confirmed the well is going dry - as opposed to other problems having to do with the pump.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>   </p><p><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">90.730(2) </a>(""Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition"") provides that community landlords have a duty to maintain the rented spaces, vacant spaces, and common areas in a ""habitable condition"".  For purposes of your water supply, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">90.730(3)(c)</a> says a space is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks a  '_water supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained so as to provide safe drinking water and to be in good working order to the extent that the water supply system can be controlled by the landlord.""</p><p>My reading of this means that <em>even though</em> your system is failing in terms of providing an adequate supply of water, the spaces for residents owning their homes, are not ""unhabitable"" so long as it is safe and in good working order to the extent you can control the system.</p><p>As to your RV residents, your duties are not defined by the manufactured housing section of the landlord-tenant law, but by the general landlord-tenant law. See,<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.320""> ORS 90.320(1)(c)</a>. This statute imposes essentially the same obligation as that is contained in <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">ORS 90.730</a>.</p><p>One <em>caveat</em>:  Your habitability obligation is subject to the extent you can control the water supply system. While you cannot ""control"" a failing well, you can explore the feasibility of (a) digging a new well, (b) digging the existing well deeper, or (c) making sure the water problem  is not due to problems with the pump.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> I can't tell from your question whether you've explored those possibilities.</p><p>Assuming that you are unable to do either (a) or (b), due to the current condition of the underground aquifers, or financial constraints, and (c) is not the problem, then it appears your only alternative is to continue working with the municipality to bring in city water - and hope a crisis can be avoided.</p><p>This brings me to your question, i.e. what can you do to ""compel users to conserve""?  Under the Oregon landlord-tenant law, I believe your options are limited. You could institute a water conservation regime for those owning their manufactured home through a rule change<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> - assuming not over 51% objected, and assess fines for the scofflaws.  For RV tenants, you may institute the change anytime, although I suggest not less than 30-day notice.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>  Of course, enforcing this, would be difficult, since it would turn neighbor vs. neighbor.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p>On the other hand, the threat of fines, may be sufficient to compel voluntary compliance. Education is the first step, i.e. making sure that everyone is water conscious. This would include providing information to residents about detecting and repairing leaks, and installing water saving devices.</p><p>Lastly, you need to prioritize your conservation efforts.  Here is what I mean:</p><ul>	<li>RV tenants who come into the park should be informed of the situation, and told that if they don't conserve, they will be asked to leave with a 30-day notice. Before accepting them as tenants, you could require that they certify they have no leaks, and that they have installed certain water saving devices. In other words, the certification would be required as a condition of occupancy.</li>	<li>Existing RV tenants already in the park who have been residents less than one year, can also be informed of the need to conserve, or they will be asked to leave with a 30-day notice. They too could be asked to certify they have undertaken the above-referenced conservation efforts.</li>	<li>Existing RV tenants who have resided in the park over one year, should be informed of the need to conserve, or they will be asked to leave with a 60-day notice. They too could be asked to certify they have undertaken the above-referenced conservation efforts.</li>	<li>For manufactured home tenants who come into the park, they should be informed of the situation and asked to certify they have no leaks, and that they have installed certain water saving devices.</li></ul><p>For existing manufactured home tenants, you can ask, but can't require (short of a rule change) that they conserve, and certify having done  so.</p><p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">If the problem appears to be getting worse and residents leave, you should consider not filling the space - especially owners of manufactured homes - until you can get on city water.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> For a discussion of well water problems, see: <a href=""http://wellwater.engr.oregonstate.edu/well-going-dry"">http://wellwater.engr.oregonstate.edu/well-going-dry</a>.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> I'm not an expert in this area of the law, so am limited as to what your viable options are.

It applies to all housing, whether or not it is manufactured housing inside of a community. The current law provides that a landlord may not refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective lessee or tenant based upon the following factors: - Race; - Color; - Religion; - Sex; - Sexual orientation; - National origin; - Marital status; - Familial status (i.e. children under 18 years of age); and - Source of income. Under HB 2639 ""source of income"" now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance. [However, it does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.] Your concern is misplaced, but you still must be careful. HB 2639 clarifies that the prohibition against discrimination does not prevent you from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon their inability to pay rent. If you have a 33% rule, and consistently apply it, you should be fine. However, what you must do is to include in your 33% calculation, any moneys the applicant is receiving from other state, local, or federal assistance, including Section 8 subsidies (collectively ""Government Assistance""). You may not deny an applicant solely because they are receiving Government Assistance, and you must include it in your calculations. Conclusion. It is my opinion that HB 2639 means that going forward, you should include all Government Assistance, as well as other income, when calculating your applicants' ability to pay the space rent. In other words, just because they receive Government Assistance does not mean that you may deny them occupancy. Lastly, even if they qualify under your 33% rule, after including their Government Assistance, if there are other legitimate grounds for denial, such as prior rental history or criminal record, you are still legally entitled to reject them. Please understand that this is not legal advice, and you should verify my interpretation with you own attorney.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1389897156,1512941618,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13562,"<br><p><strong>Question: </strong>Are parks required to provide a working phone line to the resident's space so they can have phone service?

Accordingly, the 2016 law provides that a person commits the crime of ""invasion of personal privacy"" if they knowingly record others in an area where they have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".  To put the ""expectation of privacy"" in context, I would suggest that a woman or man going to a public beach with a scantily clad bathing suit, should not expect the zone of privacy to apply to them. However, if they are in their enclosed backyard, they would.  </p><br><p>The statute, in more prosaic terms, reads thusly:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""> </p><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;"">Places and circumstances where the person has a reasonable expectation of ""personal privacy"" includes, but is not limited to, a bathroom, dressing room, locker room that includes an enclosed area for dressing or showering, tanning booth and any area where a person undresses in an enclosed space that is not open to public view.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""> </p><p>Invasion of personal privacy in the second degree is a Class A misdemeanor.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""> </p><p><strong><em>Civil Law.</em></strong> On the civil side (as opposed to the criminal side) of the law, the common law tort concepts of negligence, assault, invasion of privacy (applying the ""reasonable expectation"" test), and nuisance, still apply, as does the law of trespass to real property. In such cases, the plaintiff would have a right to sue for damages.  However, with only limited exceptions, prevailing attorney fees are not available.</p><br><p><strong><em>Airspace. </em></strong>The Federal Aviation Administration (""FAA""), regulates airspace, including that which is above private land.

However, these are private technologies.  There are already some in place by the government.</p><br><p>I suggest the place to start, is: (a) Make sure that you have rules in place that can be used in such cases; (b) <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">ORS 90.740(4)(j)</a>, already protects ""peaceful enjoyment"" and if violated could give management the ability to curb the activity with a 30-day notice under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a>, and a non-curable 20-day notice for a repeat violation with 6-months of issuance of the first notice; (c) Check  with your local authorities to see if they have any current capacity to identify drone usage from the ground, and if they can help; (d) Issue a community wide alert  to all residents about the drone activity, and encourage reporting of all such issues, together with a warning  that could result in the filing of a complaint to the local police department.

That may be sufficient to curb this activity.</p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion.  </em></strong>As you can see, most of these prohibitions are found in one form or another, without the necessity of being addressed in your community rules. However, given their ubiquitous presence, especially by folks who are just hobbyists, I do suggest having some rules in place. Why? Because if someone was using a drone for their own prurient interests, e.g. flying over someone's fenced backyard, or for harassment purposes, it's far easier for management to take action against the perpetrator for a rules violation, than it is telling an offended or harassed resident to file a civil lawsuit or criminal complaint.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Oregon law also identifies ""critical infrastructure facilities"" for which it is a violation of the law to fly a drone over them at an altitude of under 400 feet.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> All of which are addressed in the 2016 law.</p></div></div>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1526502398,1533922000,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13409,"<br><br><p>Q:        A resident was having difficulty in selling their home in a manufactured home community.

The landlord also did not have the niece sign a rental agreement.  Now 14 months later the home has still not been sold and the former resident's niece is still living in the home.  The niece has been late on numerous occasions in paying rent, does not maintain the home and has an illegal dog (over the 20 lb limit).

If the landlord has the phone number of the original resident, he/she should let them know what is going on.  Under 90.630 if three or more 72-hour notices are sent with any 12 month period, the landlord may then issue a 30-day non-curable notice of termination.  I suggest at least 4 such notices, just to be on the safe side.  A more risky (and untested) approach, is to simply issue a 30-day notice of termination under the general (i.e. non-manufactured housing section of the law) landlord tenant law.  It is my opinion that the landlord would be within their right to do so, since the occupant is not the owner of the home and the owner of the home is not the occupant.  The manufactured housing section of the law - which requires that all notices be ""for cause"" does not technically apply here because of this distinction.

It appears the ground underneath her mobile is settling and the concrete pad has cracked. She indicated that she is worried about the water lines to her home.

However, here you may have a habitability issue. Here is what the statute says: 90.730 (Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.) provides: (2) A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition. The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home. A landlord's habitability duty under this section includes only the matters described in subsections (3) to (5) of this section. (3) For purposes of this section, a rented space is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks: (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;"" This would seem to suggest that from a habitability standpoint, as long as the pad was in good shape at the commencement of the tenancy, you no longer have any further duty to the resident. I think that conclusion would be a mistake. By your question, it sounds as if your elderly resident is concerned about her water lines. Leveling it could prevent this damage. If the condition of the pad was due to the resident's improper use, that's one thing. But here, it's due to the condition of the ground that you rented to her. She has no right to ""fix"" the ground as it's not hers to fix. Inasmuch as you own the ground, and the ground is causing the problem, I would suggest that leveling is your responsibility. If the problem was not the result of the ground, I would say it is the resident's responsibility. Look at it this way: If you do nothing, and her water lines break, she will have a damage claim against you. If you level it, that risk is greatly reduced if not eliminated. If you do pay to the have leveling done, make sure that someone checks the water lines under the home, just to make sure they have not been damaged by the cracking in the pad. There is a greater question as to whether the pad itself needs to be fixed. Leveling the home may be just a temporary fix if the problem continues.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1377553219,1402810211,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13021,"<p><strong><em>Question. </em></strong>Our park has Ash trees on most of the spaces, planted by the owners when the spaces were first occupied.

The size of the tree alone, i.e. exceeding eight inches or more DBH, does not, in itself, make it a hazard tree; there must be potential for injury or damage in the near future.</p><p>Secondly, you will note that the hazard tree statutes make no distinction as to what part of the tree causes damage or injury. Although I had some involvement, along with John Van Landingham and others, in the creation of the legislation, speaking for myself, I was focused on the tree or branches falling on a home or resident. I was not thinking about damage from root systems.</p><p>Third, a landlord's removal obligation for hazard trees speaks to felling and removing them, and removing or grinding the stumps. Again, speaking only for myself, I was not thinking about tree roots that might remain after the stump is removed. (As a layperson, I think of the stump as the unremoved portion of the downed tree, and that portion below ground necessary to return the ground to its original level, <em>sans</em> the tree. But I certainly didn't focus on requiring that landlords remove root systems.</p><p>All of this is to say that my reading of the hazard tree statutes seems to make no distinction between damage above or below ground. Moreover, I suspect we would agree that damage to the foundation of a resident's home, could fall within the definition of what constitutes a hazard tree.</p><p>Remember that pursuant to <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">ORS 90.730(4)</a>, the failure to maintain a hazard tree can constitute a habitability violation for which a tenant could bring a claim against their landlord.</p><p><strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Unfortunately, it appears to me that absent some language in the hazard tree statutes indicating an intent to exclude that portion of a tree below ground, i.e. its root system, a case could be made that remediating the damage caused by a hazard tree to a resident's home, or the cost to relevel it, is on your shoulders.   </p><p>This does not mean, however, that the root systems of all felled hazard trees need to be removed. Once the tree is downed, and the trunk removed, the root system will not (as I understand it<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>) continue to grow. That being the case, if the roots are not posing a danger to a resident's space or the common area, there should be little reason to remove it. </p><p>The take-away here, is that landlords should be proactive in assessing hazard tree issues. This may include inspection of resident spaces. And when evaluating risk, <em>landlords should look down, as well as up. </em></p><p>One interesting question, which I will not opine on here, is what a landlord should do about an otherwise healthy tree that is least eight inches DBH, if its root system poses, or could pose, a risk of damage to a resident's home.

In other words, it is the resident's primary responsibility to either promptly repair, replace, or remove the home.  The space is still under lease or rental to the resident, so all of the same rules apply, i.e. to keep it in good condition and safe. If the home is nothing more than a shell, the resident should likely remove it as soon as possible.</p><p>If the resident does not have fire insurance to repair or replace the home, I suspect he or she will abandon it, thus making it your problem - or the problem of the lienholder if there is one.  Incidentally, if there is a lienholder, the loan documents likely require fire insurance, and that it be a named insured on the policy.  If that is the case, then hopefully, between the resident and their insurance company, there may be available proceeds to repair or replace.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p>If the resident abandons the home, you should immediately send out a 45-day abandonment letter, thus triggering your right (and duty) to take control of the personal property.  It is likely an attractive nuisance for children, which could result in injury to them, and liability to you.  In such case, you should consider having it either cordoned off with ""No Trespassing"" signs, or removed.  Make sure that you independently confirm that it is a total loss, and with no salvage value.

What are the landlord's rights and responsibilities in this situation?  The home will likely have to be moved.  Who pays and what are the timelines, responsibilities and liabilities? Should we accept rent during this time? What if the tenants walk away - abandonment apply under these circumstances?</p><p><strong>Answer.   </strong>The land is owned by the landlord, not the tenant. While the landlord has certain responsibilities regarding the ground,<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> most of these duties apply at the time in installation of the home.</p><p>However, ORS 90.730(3)(g) provides:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">(g) Excluding the normal settling of land, a surface or ground capable of supporting a manufactured dwelling approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained to support a dwelling in a safe manner so that it is suitable for occupancy.

If the home is not habitable due to the dangerous condition of the ground, I believe the tenant should be relocated immediately. If there is danger to the home and tenant, he/she should vacate, and resume occupancy only after the home has been relocated.  In the meantime, I would not recommend accepting rent for a space that is dangerous or not habitable.</p><p>If the home is damaged, that is the tenant's responsibility to repair -- hopefully he/she has casualty insurance.</p><p>In terms of timing, much depends on the severity of the erosion. As for the cost of the move, that is a good question. The statutes don't address. I believe it could be covered by the tenant's insurance company, if there is insurance.  If not, and the tenant cannot afford the move, something has to happen. The landlord's insurance company may provide coverage, since it was a storm-caused event and affected the park's property. For example, if the storm cause a tree limb to fall on a tenant's home, the park's carrier would likely have to pay. It is not much different with water damage endangering part of the park occupied by tenants. Both water and trees causing storm damage are Acts of God, and this is exactly what liability insurance is for. </p><p>If there is no insurance coverage, I would suggest the cost be borne 50-50 between landlord and tenant, since both need the problem to be resolved, and the current statutes do not provide a clear answer. I suppose if the tenant refused -- arguing that the space was created by the landlord, and must assume the risk of erosion along the waterfront -- it might end up that the landlord should pay, just to avoid litigation.</p><p>If the tenant abandons the home, the landlord would proceed under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.675"">ORS 90.675</a>.

For purposes of answering the question, I will assume that the payor and the payee both have an Oregon manufactured structures dealer's (""MSD"") license. However, that license only permits one to conduct business from a single location. If a person wanted to conduct business elsewhere, they would need to have a supplemental license (Form 440-2963). See, statutes here. My concern with the payment of referral fees between separate dealers, is that it blurs the distinction between the ""single location"" requirement. In other words, the payee would be receiving compensation from his own business location and another (unrelated) business location as well. I would not be too concerned if the two locations where owned by the same person or entity, but if not, there could be regulatory problems with the responsible agency, Finance &amp; Corporate Securities Division (""DFCS""). Legally, there could be additional ramifications. Say the recipient of the fee made a misrepresentation to the customer, or there was a material defect in the home that resulted in injuries. If litigation ensued, the plaintiff would have two potential targets rather than one. Under the Oregon real estate licensing laws, one broker may pay a referral fee to another broker associated with an unrelated company. However, this is expressly permitted by statute. I see nothing in the statutes allowing MSDs to engage in referral fee activity, so would not recommend it without first checking with the DFCS.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1376351713,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13567,"<p><strong>Question: </strong>We have recently had a rash of suspicious people in the park in the middle of the night, which has been making several of the residents nervous.  About a week ago, somebody came in and boldly stole a small utility trailer out of our RV storage lot.

My concern is, by doing so would that make me more liable if something gets stolen?  We have always told the residents that we do not provide security, but there is inherent security in living in such close quarters.  What I don't want to happen, is I put a security system in, something gets stolen, and I end up liable for the theft.</p><br>",963,997,1580,16667,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Installing Security Cameras In Communities,"<p><strong>Answer:  </strong>I think the first order of business would be to research the different types of security cameras, and their range of use.  You need to know what features they all have.</p><br><p>I do not know what you mean when you say that you ""have always told the residents that we do not provide security... .""  It's one thing to remind residents of their own responsibility to protect their property, and another to have posted signage saying so. You should develop a written policy, circulate it and post it.</p><br><p>Also, you don't say whether you have a separate storage charge for use of the RV storage lot. Nor do you say whether access is limited, e.g. through a gate.  Generally, when one (e.g. a landlord) provides separate storage facilities, you can expect some degree of liability to attach unless access is controlled, e.g. by a security fence.</p><p>My initial reaction to the idea of security cameras is generally good, subject to the following caveats:</p><p>-      If it is not monitored, tenants should know that, so they do not have unrealistic expectations of the system's efficacy.</p><p>-      Make sure that the system is visible with warning signs; I would expect that most security camera companies provide such signage.</p><p>-      Make sure the tenants understand the limitations of the surveillance; I would want to have written disclaimers to all residents that they store their RVs at their own risk. </p><p>-       I would even have a short written and signed agreement of understanding with tenants before allowing them to use the facilities.  </p><p>This area of the law is known as ""bailments"", i.e. when someone provides storage of personal property to another. Think of places where you can check your hat or coat. Even the little ticket they give you has visible disclaimers.

When I served it she told me that she is a victim of domestic violence and would provide me a copy of the restraining order, she also told me that she would have her attorney contact me. Neither occurred. She paid her rent by the final date on the notice. She hasn't paid rent yet this month. I still have no copies of a restraining order, nor has her husband informed me that he has moved out. She is the only one to tell me about domestic violence. I just served her with another 72 hour notice. She is upset and yelled that I can't evict her because she is still dealing with issues as a victim of domestic violence. She also told me that she now has two attorneys and that she will have them both call me. I informed her to read the notice carefully as rent will need to be paid by the 13th or I would file in court on the 14th. My question is this: Is domestic violence a recognized defense to non-payment of rent?</p>",963,997,1580,15727,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Is Domestic Violence a Defense to Non-Payment of Rent?,"<p>Answer: Domestic violence is a defense to eviction, but only under the proper circumstances. I have set out the law in its entirety below. As you can see, the law presumes there has been a violent act for which the landlord is evicting everyone in the space, i.e. the villain and the victim. The domestic violence law says you cannot evict the victim for the violent act. But it also says the villain and the victim are still responsible for rent. It also requires a valid third-party affirmation to the event. In short, based on your question, it does not sound as if the domestic violence statute will provide a defense to an action for nonpayment of rent. You should tell the victim that you do not believe the domestic violence law applies in these circumstances (i.e. nonpayment of rent) and that if her attorney believes otherwise, he must call you immediately and explain why. Is she is a serial late pay for which you have to issue multiple non-payment of rent notices, you might consider a 3-strikes notice under ORS 90.630(8). DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STALKING 90.445 Termination of tenant committing criminal act of physical violence. (1) If a tenant perpetrates a criminal act of physical violence related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking against a household member who is a tenant, after delivery of at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the act or omission constituting the cause and specifying the date and time of the termination, the landlord may: (a) Terminate the rental agreement of the perpetrating tenant, but may not terminate the rental agreement of the other tenants; and (b) If the perpetrator of the criminal act of physical violence related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking continues to occupy the premises after the termination date and time specified in the notice, seek a court order under ORS 105.128 to remove the perpetrator from the premises and terminate the perpetrator's tenancy without seeking a return of possession from the remaining tenants. (2) A landlord that terminates the tenancy of a perpetrator under this section may not require the remaining tenants to pay additional rent or an additional deposit or fee due to exclusion of the perpetrator.

There is no fixed time for management's response as to whether the repairs have been satisfactorily and timely performed; it is sufficient if it is within a reasonable time following the tenant's written notice.

As you know, most park rules, as well as Oregon's landlord-tenant laws, make residents responsible for the conduct of their guests.

However, before doing so, you should contact your local law enforcement jurisdiction for directions. This is because they may have their own rules on how they will respond and under what circumstances.  For example, they may say that the notice has to be served on the visitor, i.e. it isn'tenough to give it to the resident to give to the visitor.

All it takes is a little familiarity with that labyrinthine set of statutes in Oregon's Residential Landlord Tenant Act, or ""RLTA."" </p><br><p>However, oftentimes it is not until the first appearance following the filing of the eviction that the landlord discovers that the tenant has gone to an attorney and is now raising various counterclaims.  In your case, it was be for the failure to provide an essential service.</p><br><p>Assuming that the tenant has the money to pay the <em><u>entire</u></em> rent due, this is a battle that you are almost certain to lose. The reason is found in the rent-tender statute, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.370"">ORS 90.370</a> (Tenant Counterclaims).  Essentially, this statute, and several cases that have construed it, permit the tenant to tender the past-due rent into Court, even though it was not paid during the 72-hour period set forth in your notice.  At the conclusion of the case, if the Court finds that the amount tendered into Court covers the amount found to be due, the tenant automatically retains possession. The tenant is permitted to hedge their bet.</p><br><p><strong>                        Example</strong>:  Landlord files an eviction against Tenant based upon the failure to pay monthly rent of $400.  Tenant files counterclaims alleging habitability violations, and claims that because of the deficiencies, the market rent for the premises is only $200 per month.  Tenant has had possession for seven months (including the month for which rent was not paid) and asks for the return of $200 for each of the prior six months.  Tenant tenders $400 into Court prior to the commencement of trial.  Assuming that the claims are in good faith, here are the various scenarios:</p><br><p>                        1.  <strong>Worst Case</strong> <strong>for You</strong>:  The Court finds in favor of the tenant, awarding him a judgment for $1,200 (6 months X $200) plus costs and attorney fees.</p><br><p>                        2.  <strong>Best Case for You</strong>:  Although the Court finds against tenant on his counterclaims, and therefor finds that the amount due to you is the full $400, since it has already been tendered into Court, the tenant is allowed to retain possession and may submit a request for recovery of his costs and attorney fees.   </p><br><p>                        The <u>only</u> exception to the ""Best Case"" scenario is where you are able to convince the Court that the counterclaims are improper and/or have been filed in bad faith.  In that case, the rent tender will do the tenant no good, and if the tenant loses his counterclaims, he will be evicted and become subject to a judgment for your costs and attorney fees.</p><br><p>So, when should a landlord fight to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent, where the tenant has made a tender into Court?  Only in the following situations: (a) Where the landlord is confident that he/she can convince the Court that the counterclaims were filed in bad faith; or, (b) Where the rent tender is believed to be inadequate and the tenant's attorney does not know that the shortfall could be tendered into Court.  In virtually every other situation, the odds of winning a contested nonpayment of rent eviction where there has been a rent tender are very rare.</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Conclusion</u></em></strong><strong><em>.  </em></strong>I agree with you that it would be bad precedent to permit this situation to continue, as it could metastasize throughout the rest of the community of affected residents.  I also agree that it would be unwise to accept partial rent, unless you could do so with a written agreement where the tenant acknowledges that you are not waiving the shortfall.</p><br><p>I suggest that you thoroughly vet the cause of the bursting pipes, so as to leave no doubt that a failure of maintenance was not the problem. Speak to one or more experts and try to get a written statement as to the cause.  With that you might then try to reason with the tenant - if that's possible. Reasoning with a person who refuses to obtain legal advice is often difficult.</p><br><p>One possibility is to privately meet with the resident and see if some accommodation can be reached. If we're only talking about $90.00 (6X$15), perhaps he would agree to pay the full rent, and you could provide some ancillary park service of equivalent service for free. I'm sure this doesn't sound attractive, but if he sticks to his guns, the end game will likely not end well for you - unless you have thoroughly vetted the issue of responsibility and provided him with proof that this was an act of God. </p><br><p>There is another, slightly imaginative, but possibly effective, solution: Issue a 72-hour notice for each month he tenders partial rent that you reject (making sure you photo each check), and then on the third one, issue a non-curable 30-day notice under Oregon's three-strike law.

If the structure is expressly identified in the park documents, and allocates maintenance responsibility to the resident, then the issue is clearer.  But it is my opinion that if the documents are silent about park-owned structures on the space, the duty to maintain, paint, etc., lies with the landlord. Why? Because the landlord drafted or selected the documents for the resident to sign, and accordingly, could have delegated the responsibility in whatever manner he/she saw fit.  Having failed to do so, means that the agreement or rule will most likely be construed most strictly ""against the drafter"" - i.e. to the landlord.</p><br><p>Clearly, if the structure was on the space at the inception of the tenancy (therefor presumptively belonging to the landlord), when the resident departs, it would remain there. Similarly, if some liability occurred, it would fall on the landlord, unless it was from an event caused by the resident. </p><br><p>For example, say there is a storage shed located on the space at the start of the tenancy, and nothing is said in the park documents about maintenance responsibility. The resident uses the shed to store family items, including old photos and collectibles.  Unbeknownst to the resident, the shed is not completely water resistant, and over the course of the winter, they are destroyed.  Unless there is some evidence the resident knew about the leakage and did nothing to protect their belongings, this is likely a landlord liability.</p><br><p> Is this an instance in which the landlord could protect themselves by having a release of liability  agreement saying that the resident assumes all responsibility for destruction or loss of any valuables stored in the shed?  Possibly, but not absolutely. In other words, the more specific the agreement was, the better the chances are it would be enforced to the benefit of the landlord. But a simple statement saying that the resident assumes all responsibility for the contents stored in the shed, might not go far enough.  Remember, absent the resident's duty to maintain the shed, if the landlord has the maintenance responsibility, management is arguably somewhat  responsible for making sure that the shed is watertight - at least that's the argument the resident's attorney would make. So how can the landlord, who has the duty to maintain the shed, abdicate responsibility for not maintaining it in a secure manner? </p><br><p>Accordingly, to have a more enforceable release agreement, I submit that landlords should also have an agreement providing that: (a) landlord does not have a duty to maintain, inspect, or secure it; (b) landlord does not warrant or guarantee that the shed is waterproof, or free from mold and mildew; (c) before use, the resident should assure himself/herself that it is suitable for storage of the specific contents intended to be stored there; and (d) that the resident covenants and agrees to maintain the exterior and interior of the shed for the duration of the tenancy.  Only then can you expect a full release and hold harmless clause to be effective, since by signing, the resident is now making an informed decision about the scope of responsibilities under the agreement going forward. </p><br><p>So the take-away here is that if you have not addressed these issues for park-owned structures in the lease, rental agreement and/or rules, you should do so upon turnover of the space. Until then, it would likely be difficult to shift responsibility onto a resident, when it was not expressly bargained for at the inception of the tenancy.</p><br><p>Similarly, even though a resident builds the structure, you may want to address these issues in a separate written agreement <em>before the structure is built</em>. In addition, you want to make sure that the construction of a tenant-built structure conforms to all applicable building codes and ordinances, including, where applicable, the taking out of one or more building permits. And if the resident hires a contractor, you will want to use MHCO Form No. 52.</p><br><p>And importantly, you will want to address whether the resident has a duty to remove it upon sale of the home.  Alternatively, you can provide that the landlord reserves the right to make that decision if/when the resident who built it gives notice of intent to sell or remove the home. And if it stays, you'll want to have an agreement with the new resident, addressing the issues described above.</p><br><p>Lastly, if the structure is something built for children to play on, e.g. swing sets, ladders, slides, etc., I strongly recommend that you require the resident who built it, take it with them. Under no circumstances do you want to lease or rent space to another resident with this apparatus there. It creates too much liability for management, and even if it remained after a resident left, I would remove it before permitting possession by new residents with small children. </p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1488213834,1488213834,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13412,"<br><br><p>Question:        A landlord recently informed the residents of the manufactured home community that they will no longer accept applications of new residents.

Since your social security number is your unique identifier, it can provide thieves with a valuable tool, should they want to secure your credit information and ultimately your identity for purposes of securing credit under your name. Here is what the Social Security Administration says about your number:</p><p>Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America. A dishonest person who has your Social Security number can use it to get other personal information about you. Identity thieves can use your number and your good credit to apply for more credit in your name. Then, they use the credit cards and do not pay the bills. You may not find out that someone is using your number until you are turned down for credit or you begin to get calls from unknown creditors demanding payment for items you never bought. Someone illegally using your Social Security number and assuming your identity can cause a lot of problems.</p><p>Your number is confidential</p><p>The Social Security Administration protects your Social Security number and keeps your records confidential. We do not give your number to anyone, except when authorized by law. You should be careful about sharing your number, even when you are asked for it. You should ask why your number is needed, how it will be used and what will happen if you refuse. The answers to these questions can help you decide if you want to give out your Social Security number.</p><p>Oregon has the Identity Theft Protection Act which prohibits person's and companies who maintain Social Security numbers as a form of customer identifier from printing a consumer's SSN on any mailed materials not requested by the consumer (unless redacted) and printing a consumer's SSN on a card used by the consumer that is required to access products or services.</p><p>While there is plenty of information about how to protect against identity theft, the real issue, when must I turn over my SSN to someone who is asking for it? The list is actually pretty short, and somewhat expected. The major ones are: credit card applications (discussed below); cash transactions over $10,000 (required by the IRS 1); when applying for certain federal benefits; for U.S. military paperwork; for employment purposes; and, when applying for a license through the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles. 2</p><p>Your question focuses on credit card applications related to your business. For consumers, their SSN is almost the sine qua non for obtaining credit. In other words, if you refuse to provide you SSN, you can kiss your application goodbye. Armed with your SSN and virtually nothing else, a car dealer or other merchant, can almost immediately determine your credit score. However, providing it to your doctor's office or other provider may not be necessary. Much depends on whether you are on Medicare or Medicaid.</p><p>While it might be nice, as a business owner, if you could use your Employer ID number (EIN), if you had one, the issue is that when extending credit for small businesses, it is far easier to run a credit check on the consumer, i.e. you, that your business, which until recently, was not an option. However, in December 2013, FICO, the primary credit scoring company in the country, has opened up a service for small businesses. Here is what they say on their website here:</p><p>Getting approved for a loan is a major challenge for small business owners, but the reason they're denied credit is often kept secret. That's about to change as one key player in the credit scoring industry makes its small business scores available to owners for the first time.</p><p>FICO (FICO) scores are used as tools for lenders to determine the creditworthiness of applicants. Its general scores have been available to individual consumers for years, but its small business scores have only been disclosed to lenders.<br />Now, the service is partnering with companies like Creditera, an online credit monitoring system, to bring more transparency to the process. It won't be free, like many of its consumer scores are, but come January, business owners who subscribe to Creditera will be able to see FICO's Small Business Scoring Service measurement.</p><p>The change will allow small business owners to see how they're being judged by lenders, giving them a better idea of what kind of credit and rates they should expect.</p><p>Conclusion. Although this entire issue is beyond my legal knowledge, this approach, i.e. to obtain extensions of credit through your business, may enable you to use your EIN rather than your SSN. Since they are both 9-digit numbers, it may be possible to use the EIN rather than your SSN. In some business and tax forms, they are used somewhat interchangeably.</p><p>While this approach would not necessarily prevent someone from stealing your EIN, identity thieves typically go after the low hanging fruit, i.e. the SSNs, which are much more ubiquitous than EINs. Again, I admit I'm a bit out of my element on this question. I acknowledge that even getting an extension of business credit, may entail, at least initially, the use of your SSN. However, it may be worth a try, in order to see if, over time, when applying for business credit, you can use the company's EIN rather than your SSN. For more on the difference between the two, see this helpful link here.</p><p>1 Actually, the IRS form 8300 asks for the TIN, or ""taxpayer identification number,"" which is the same as the EIN, or ""Employer Identification Number."" For individuals, that is normally their social security number.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1404920759,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,488,"<p>Question: A resident in our community has ants in her home.

If ""yes,"" the it's your responsibility to abate; if ""no"" then it's the tenant's responsibility. Here is a summary of the applicable statute. I have highlighted that portion of the law which applies to your issue: ORS 90.730 [Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.] provides in relevant part: - A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition. - The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home. - A landlord's habitability duty includes only the following: _ A sewage disposal system and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the sewage disposal system can be controlled by the landlord; _ If required by applicable law, a drainage system reasonably capable of disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water, approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order; _ A water supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained so as to provide safe drinking water and to be in good working order to the extent that the water supply system can be controlled by the landlord; _ An electrical supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the electrical supply system can be controlled by the landlord; _ At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin; _ Except as otherwise provided by local ordinance or by written agreement between the landlord and the tenant, an adequate number of appropriate receptacles for garbage and rubbish in clean condition and good repair at the time of commencement of the rental agreement, and for which the landlord shall provide and maintain appropriate serviceable receptacles thereafter and arrange for their removal; and _ Completion of any landlord-provided space improvements, including but not limited to installation of carports, garages, driveways and sidewalks, approved under applicable law at the time of installation. - A rented space is considered unhabitable if the landlord does not maintain a hazard tree as required by ORS 90.727. - A vacant space in a facility is considered unhabitable if the space substantially lacks safety from the hazards of fire or injury. - A facility common area is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks: _ Buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin; _ Safety from the hazards of fire; _ Trees, shrubbery and grass maintained in a safe manner; and _ If supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord to a common area, a water supply system, sewage disposal system or system for disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the system can be controlled by the landlord. - Note that the landlord and tenant may agree in writing that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks and minor remodeling only if: _ The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord; _ The agreement does not diminish the obligations of the landlord to other tenants on the premises; and _ The terms and conditions of the agreement are clearly and fairly disclosed and adequate consideration for the agreement is specifically stated. The term ""vermin"" is defined as: ""Small insects and animals (such as fleas or mice) that are sometimes harmful to plants or other animals and that are difficult to get rid of."" [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vermin] That's a pretty broad definition, and I'm going to assume that ""vermin"" include ants. So the question is, was this condition one that existed at the commencement of the tenancy? If the resident had been at the space for years and never complained until now, I suspect they [or their exterminator] would have a tough time establishing when the problem first occurred. As you know, pests come and go; they could be seasonal, weather related, food related, hygiene related, etc. Chances are that if one resident has ants, others may as well. Had the resident come to you before hiring the exterminator, I would have suggested that you find out how widespread the problem was, and if it was prevalent throughout the community [or a specific area within the community] perhaps work out some cost-sharing arrangement along with a periodic maintenance schedule to eradicate the problem. That was not done here. However, good community relations suggests that you find out the breadth of the problem, and if it affects several residents, discuss a solution with all of them that works for your pocketbook, and the residents' budget. Whether you pay for the exterminator for one resident, might set a bad precedent, since it could encourage others to do the same. That's why you want to find out the scope of the problem.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1400601777,1403474063,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12776,"<p>Question: Please tell me what I must do when I reject a prospective tenant's application to move into our community.</p>",963,997,1580,15876,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Landlord's Rejection Of Application For Tenancy,"<p>Answer: The applicable statute is ORS 90.304.

Rather, in cases where the tenant apparently abandons the home (or at least is ignoring his/her space rent responsibilities while gone), the landlord should send the 72-hour notice to the tenant at the tenant's space. If the tenant has another address known to the landlord, he an send a ""courtesy copy"" so marked, with an advisory that the original was sent to the space. Upon expiration of the 72 hours without payment, the landlord may file for eviction. If the tenant does not show up at the first appearance, the landlord may obtain a judgment of restitution and recover back possession of the space. Then the landlord may send out a 45-day abandonment letter.

As new managers, we are concerned about being able to spot problem issues before they get out of control. What are some of the major management mistakes we should watch out for?</p>",963,997,1580,15753,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Major Management Mistakes - Identifying Issues Before They Spiral Out of Control,"<p>Answer: There are several issues that I see repeatedly. Here are a few: 1. Managers not adequately papering their file before taking legal action against a resident. Judges want to see that you've ""walked the extra mile"" with the resident, making every reasonable effort to bring them into compliance. This means starting with a personal conversation with them about the problem and then making notes of the date, time, and matters discussed and the resident's responses. Next try a note or letter without using a formal termination notice. Only after it becomes apparent that you will have to go the formal route should you do so. 2. Failing to act promptly when a resident violate the rules. Although many things are not waivable, such as maintenance violations, some definitely are, such as unpermitted pets or occupants. When there is a belief that the resident has either an unapproved pet or occupant, the resident should be contacted immediately. With pets (assuming they are not in violation of the rules against breeds, or numbers), you want to promptly get them onto a Pet Agreement. With occupants you should use the Occupancy Agreement and run a background check. (Make sure you don't require a financial background check, since that is not permitted on occupants - only tenants.) If the resident delays in complying, get a 30-day notice issued and do not accept rent until the matter is resolved. I have seen too many managers accept rent and work for months with the resident, not realizing that they are being lulled into believing the resident will ultimately cooperate - until it's too late. 3. Failing to properly prepare a notice of termination. Oregon law is very strict when it comes to the preparation of notices. Even the slightest error can be fatal. Make sure you're using the correct MHCO form [e.g. don't use a 30-day notice for failure to maintain under ORS 90.630, when you should be using a 30-day notice for repair and deterioration under ORS 90.632.] When you draft the notice, have someone else read it for content and accuracy. Then do so again yourself. If you realize that you sent out an incorrectly prepared notice, send out a corrected one and state that it rescinds and replaces the incorrect one. 4. Accepting residents you have doubts about. Always do a ""gut-check."" If you think the applicant would be problematic, look closely at their application and references. While you cannot and should not reject applicants arbitrarily, if they are on the cusp - i.e. you could legitimately accept or reject - give careful consideration to your decision and don't let it be dictated by your desire to just fill a space. 5. Not understanding the range of solutions when dealing with a residents. By this I mean, don't just fire out a notice as a knee jerk reaction to a violation. A good example is a resident who is intoxicated and gets into a verbal altercation with another resident. Say it gets out of control, and threats are made by the resident. If this is unusual for the resident and out of character for him, don't simply send a 24-hour notice. The law is quite clear that you are not to use a 24-hour notice if another form of notice, e.g. a curable 30-day notice would work. Remember, a repeat violation with six months following the date of the 30-day notice gives you the right to terminate with a 20-day non-curable notice. Judges don't like to terminate manufactured housing residents, given the drastic consequences. You want to show the judge that you were not being heavy-handed, but tried the most rationale and reasonable approach first.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1352736765,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,483,"<p>Question: A few years ago, a married couple originally applied together for residency in our community.

You can't evict them without cause, and as long as the remaining occupant is current, you could not do so. Besides, if the remaining occupant is receiving spousal or child support, their income might be sufficient. 4. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?

So my responses are based upon my opinion alone.  Until an appellate court rules on these issues - which is unlikely, since most such cases are never appealed - the best we can do is speculate. My answers are in <em>italics</em> below.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</strong> <em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident - even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in.  A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?  </strong><em>Technically, yes.  Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can - without your consent - alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed.  [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p><p><strong>3. Do we rescreen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?  </strong><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so - if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?  Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years?  Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can - or will make the payments?  That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced.  Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved.  The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent's individual credit score less important.   The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse.  It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.  </em></p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>If we do rescreen the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?  </strong><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above.  If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing - and I have never seen any that do - the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge.  I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria - with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules - would be a very difficult sell to most judges.  It is unlikely that you would prevail.  I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out.  If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict.  But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent <u>in the future</u>, is premature and likely to fail.   </em></p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent? </strong> <em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease.  It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy.  If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them. </em></p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1464277999,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12805,"<p>Question - A resident moves out of their house but the daughter continues to pay a storage fee and signed a MHCO Storage Agreement.

In other words, your non-renewal will not result in forcing the tenant to vacate the space.</p><p>When this law was first being discussed, this issue was addressed. Prior to enactment, there was an open question whether fixed term tenancies [i.e. leases - those with definite start and ending dates] were even legal. From the tenants' perspective, under the manufactured housing landlord-tenant laws, since a landlord cannot terminate a tenancy ""without cause,"" a lease that expires without renewal is the same thing i.e. termination without cause. Accordingly, ORS 90.545 was enacted, which provided protections to tenants against the possibility of unilateral nonrenewal.</p><p>Is this unfair to a landlord, such as yourself, when an applicant is approved, ostensibly based upon a satisfactory application, who then becomes the ""Tenant From Hell?"" Some would say that the landlord's best protection is at the front end of the business relationship, since he/she is given a full and complete opportunity to set out all screening criteria and performing a thorough vetting of the applicant's financial, rental, and criminal background. But once the landlord approves the applicant - presumably because he/she passed the vetting process - they have the right to remain at the space, so long as they don't commit certain material violations, such as nonpayment of rent, breach the rules, rental agreement, state law, or commit certain actions outrageous in the extreme.</p><p>Here is how the fixed term tenancy law, found at ORS 90.545 and 90.550, works:</p><ul>	<li>At least 60 days prior to the ending date of the lease term the landlord must provide to the tenant a proposed new lease, together with a written statement that summarizes any new or revised terms, conditions, rules or regulations.</li>	<li>The new rental agreement may include new or revised terms, conditions, rules or regulations, if:</li>	<li>They fairly implement a statute or ordinance adopted after the creation of the pre-existing lease; or</li>	<li>They are the same as those offered to new or prospective tenants at the time the new proposed lease is submitted to the tenant and for the preceding six-months prior to submission period;</li>	<li>If there have been no new or prospective tenants during the six-month period, the new lease terms must be same as are customary for the rental market; and</li>	<li>They are consistent with the rights and remedies provided to tenants under ORS Chapter 90; and</li>	<li>Do not relate to the age, size, style, construction material or year of construction of the manufactured dwelling [or floating home] contrary to ORS 90.632 (2) (Footnote 1); and</li>	<li>Do not require an alteration of the manufactured dwelling [or floating home] or alteration or new construction of an accessory building or structure.</li>	<li>The tenant may accept or reject a landlord's proposed new rental agreement at least 30 days prior to the ending of the term by giving written notice to the landlord.</li>	<li>Note that if a landlord fails to submit a proposed new rental agreement as allowed, the tenancy renews as a month-to-month tenancy under the same terms as the prior lease, except that the landlord has the right to increase the rent unilaterally, pursuant to ORS 90.600.</li>	<li>If the tenant fails to accept or unreasonably rejects a landlord's proposed new rental agreement, the fixed term tenancy terminates on the ending date without further notice and the landlord may take possession through the eviction process, assuming the tenant does not vacate the space and remove the home.</li>	<li>However, if the tenant surrenders possession of the space prior to the filing an eviction, he/she has the right to enter into a written storage agreement with the landlord, and then has the same rights and responsibilities of a lienholder during an abandonment, i.e. pay storage fees, maintain the space, and sell the home within six months [rather than 12 for lienholders]. See, ORS 90.675 (19).</li></ul><p>Conclusion. My suggestion is that if your tenant is continually causing problems, paper your file thoroughly, showing the efforts you've made to work with that person. If there are complaints from other residents, document them. Eventually, the tenant will slip up - doing something that gives you the basis for an eviction. If he is a chronic late payer, consider using the three strikes law, found in ORS 90.630(8). Then find a good landlord attorney and discuss the best method to evict the tenant. You will then be armed with good evidence for the judge or jury to show that you walked the extra mile with this person, but they simply refused to cooperate.

This case addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in Oregon, both from an employment and housing perspective. Interestingly, today, a website search on the <a href=""http://fhco.org/"">Oregon Fair Housing Council's </a><a href=""http://fhco.org/"">website</a>for any information or discussion about landlords making ""reasonable accommodations"" for medical marijuana users, reveals not a single word.

These principles require federalprosecutors deciding which cases to prosecuteto weigh all relevant considerations, includingfederal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,and the cumulative impactof particular crimes on the community.</p><br><p>This means that today, in Oregon, landlords have it within their control, with little fear of a fair housing/reasonable accommodation claims, to enact rules and regulations prohibiting the on-premises use of recreational or medical marijuana.

This doesn't cause quite as much heartburn for property owners who have wisely passed such utilities through to the residents to pay in addition to their rent. However, for the overwhelming majority of properties, particularly those which were developed prior to the 90's, the rent charged typically includes any combination of utilities including water, sewer, garbage, and to a lesser percentage electricity, natural gas, cable television/satellite, and internet services.</p>",963,997,1580,15999,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: MHCO's New Form 2A - Where is the Security Agreement Filed?,"<p>From one year to the next, the only certainty one can realistically expect is that rents will need to be adjusted just to keep pace with the utility increases that are coming one's way from the various providers. The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs? Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies. We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services.</p><p>Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year. Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin. This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent.</p><p>A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense. You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption. This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption. Rates are high now and will continue to rise. A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities. All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility.</p><p>You need to be aware that your business is under attack. Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges. As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice: 1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment. This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list. The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing. The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees. Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing. The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"". I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity. The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law.</p><p>Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent. Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"". This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges.</p><p>One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states. We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another. Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide. Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense. Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board.</p><p>If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents.

At the same time as the submeter conversion, I want begin billing for common area fees and utility bills under a 'pro rata billing method'. As far as I understand, that scenario is covered in the statutes. Here is my dilemma: The local municipality doesn't charge much of anything for actual water usage...it ends up only being about $6 per month/per space to pay for all water usage in the community. The way the city gets their money is by constantly adding and increasing 'utility fees' like storm drain, public safety, etc. After running my numbers, I am beginning to question why I even want to go to the expense of installing water meters at all, because if it just ends up raising the monthly out-of-pocket cost for my senior residents, and even If they reduce their water usage significantly, they will only be able to realistically save a dollar or two per month. What I would like to do instead is just begin a 'pro rata billing method' for my community electricity, garbage, natural gas and city utility fees. I would obviously offset their rent amount commensurate with the previous 12 months' total bills. What I cannot figure out after reading the statutes is this: Can I begin a pro rata billing method for the above mentioned items, with 180 days' written notice, WITHOUT converting to a submeter billing method at the same time?</p>",963,997,1580,15732,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: More Questions on Water Sub-Metering,"<p>Answer: ORS 90.532 (3) provides as follows: Except as allowed by subsection (2) of this section for rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, a landlord and tenant may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service billing from a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(i) [i.e. where the charge is included in the base rent] *** to a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) [i.e. where the charge is billed separately from base rent and apportioned among the tenants on a pro rata basis as measured by a master meter]. The exception covered in subsection ORS 90.532(2) provides as follows: A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method: (a) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010. (b) For sewer service, if it is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010. Translating this to plain English, here is my take: - For rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010 you may not convert water or sewer charges from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method except as follows: _ Water service: If the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless you were using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010. _ Sewer Service: If sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, you may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata method, unless you were already using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010. - Garbage service: You may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant. There does not appear to be any time frame limitation on this rule Pursuant to ORS 90.534 [Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area], if a written rental agreement so provides, you may use a pro rata billing method with a master meter and require tenants to pay you a utility or service charges (e.g. electrical and natural gas) that has been billed to you or provided directly to the tenant's space or to a common area. However, you may not unilaterally amend an existing rental agreement to convert utility and service billing from an in-rent billing method to a pro rata billing method. It appears you could use the pro rata billing method (other than sewer and water) per above rules, only on a going forward basis with new residents. Conclusion. This is the best I can tell you. It is not legal advice, and based only upon my interpretation of the statutes which are quite complex. It appears that yours is a difficult situation in which water/sewer submetering will not actually help. With the exception of garbage service, there is no easy answer. However, upon closer evaluation by your attorney, perhaps you may be able to figure out a work-around solution.

The rationale for the law is fairly obvious - the presence of a sexual predator inside the community creates an inherent danger to other residents and their guests.</p><p>Of course, the statute only addresses <em>other tenants. </em>It says nothing about invitees of tenants who may come into the community to provide materials or other services, which is what your question deals with. However, a guest or invitee who is a sexual predator is no less of a threat when he's inside the community than a resident who is a sexual predator. For that reason, i.e. the safety and security of other residents, you should act promptly. Before doing so, though, be sure that you personally verify that he is a registered sex offender, and, if possible, obtain a copy of the document verifying it for your records. Then proceed as follows:</p><ol>	<li>Contact the resident for whom the person is working and tell him or her of the community's concern, and ask that the worker be told that due to his criminal record he may no longer come into the community.  If the resident agrees to cooperate, that should suffice. <em>[Note: This approach assumes that the resident is cooperative in nature, and there is little or no risk that he will return.  If the resident is uncooperative, then proceed to No. 2 below.]</em></li>	<li>If the resident refuses to cooperate, then you will have to escalate the matter. Deliver a No-Trespassing notice to the resident to give to the maintenance person, saying that he may no longer come to the community <em>for any reason. </em>The letter should say that if he violates this demand, you will call the police and have him removed as a trespasser. <em>[Note: My preference would be to deliver it to the workman (with copy to resident) personally, since that way you'll know he has actual notice. However, I would leave the decision to you. If you do it in person, make sure you have another witness with you.

But remember, as a park owner <em>[this is not something managers should do without the owner's express knowledge and consent] </em>you have a duty to avoid dangerous situations you become aware of, and the frequent presence of a known registered sexual predator in the community certainly qualifies.       </p><div><hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> ORS 181.800(3) provides that a  '_level three sex offender who presents the highest risk of reoffending and requires the widest range of notification.""</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> ORS 181.838 relates to juveniles, and provides that (1)  '_a person is a predatory sex offender if the person: (a) Is required to report as a sex offender under ORS 181.809 as the result of a finding that the person committed an act that if committed by an adult in this state would constitute a predatory sex offense; and (b) Exhibits characteristics showing a tendency to victimize or injure others.

So how does a partial payment get allocated when some of the payment includes utilities?

Rent is the charge for the resident's right to remain at the space. As you know from the MHCO 72-hour Notice, the right to evict only arises when the rent remains unpaid for seven days following the date of payment, which is usually the first of the month. The extra charges for late fees, utilities, and other expenses the landlord has a right to collect under the rental or lease agreement do not provide the basis for eviction under the 72-hour Notice. A landlord's right to terminate a tenancy for payment of non-rent charges can be handled in two ways: (a) By issuance of a 30-day notice of termination; or (b) Small Claims Court. If the resident's payment does not include 100% of the rent that is due, that is a different story. In that case, the landlord does not have to accept partial rent. However, if a landlord is willing to do so, he/she must secure a written agreement. Here's what ORS 90.417 says: - A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. - If the acceptance of a partial payment of rent is in accordance with the following protocol, it does not constitute a waiver of the landlord's right to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of the balance of the rent owed. - Here is the required protocol: Acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant's rental agreement for nonpayment of rent unless: _ The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before he/she gave a nonpayment of rent notice based on the tenant's agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the balance of the rent as agreed; _ The landlord's 72-hour notice must be served no earlier than it would have been permitted under the 72-hour notice statute, had no rent been accepted; and _ The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or _ The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of rent termination notice and entered into a written agreement with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The written agreement may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and file for eviction without serving a new 72-hour notice if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time certain. - Note that a landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent can be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule specified in the agreement.

Essentially, the condition said that if when the resident sought to sell the home to a new buyer, the landlord could consent, but could add the condition that the home had to be removed on resale.

However, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">ORS 90.740</a> (Tenant Obligations), provided for several things I believed we could incorporate into the MHCO Rental and Lease Agreements. Among other things, the statute provides that residents must:</p><br><ul>	<li>Keep the dwelling or home, and the rented space, safe from the hazards of fire;</li>	<li>Install and maintain in the dwelling or home a smoke alarm approved under applicable law;</li>	<li>Install and maintain storm water drains on the roof of the dwelling or home and connect the drains to the drainage system, if any;</li>	<li>Use electrical, water, storm water drainage and sewage disposal systems in a reasonable manner and maintain the connections to those systems;</li></ul><br><p>And since ORS 90.630(1)(a) provides that  '_the landlord may terminate a rental agreement *** if the tenant: (a) <em><u>Violates a law or ordinance</u></em> related to the tenant's conduct as a tenant...

What we're are seeing is a huge net of bureaucratic regulation that has been cast over even the smallest of transactions under the guise of consumer protection.</p><p>Going forward, my suggestion is for park owners to decide if: (a) They want to handle these transactions without the use of a MLO (which will add several hundred dollars to each sale) or (b) Go it alone. If the latter, my suggestion is to create the simplest of paper transactions, with a fair market rate of interest, no adjustable rates, no negative amortizations. Balloon payments are permissible.  However, there is a limit on this safe-harbor. If you made more than four such carry-back loan transactions in the prior calendar year, an entirely different and more complex set of rules apply, and you should consider using either a MLO or an attorney qualified in such matters.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> The Federal SAFE Act and its state counterparts, have interpreted (incorrectly in my opinion) ""loans""  to include not just funding coming from a third party lender, but also seller-carryback transactions where the seller ""carries the paper"" and collects the periodic payments.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> The statute cited to for compliance, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/646A.052"">ORS 646A.052</a>, et. seq. is antiquated and inadequate for residential housing today.

This is an issue of making a ""reasonable accommodation"" under the federal fair housing act. Handicapped persons are members of a protected class. Is the resident ""handicapped""? With the various infirmities that can come with older age, there is a likelihood that the resident could qualify as a member of that class.

It will not cost the landlord anything. It will not set a ""precedent"" since federal law requires such concessions for handicapped. All in all, it is a fairly easy solution. Note that I am not commenting on the validity of the request itself. This accommodation is not costly or risky, so the analysis is fairly simple. The harder cases are where the resident wants to bring in a pit bull or other breed with a dangerous reputation; as an ""assistance animal,"" or the assistance provider, while a relative, has a recent criminal record for violence. If these cases, the landlord has to evaluate the legitimacy of the request, the need to accommodate a ""pit bull"" or ex-con, versus some other alternative, and the likelihood the resident will contest an outright denial. In this case, I have no problem with having the son fill out an informational form containing contact information, background information and a criminal check. However, since he is not applying for residency, his financial qualifications are irrelevant, since he is there to lend assistance, not pay rent.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1346192069,1402810306,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12896,"<p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status."" In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class. This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement. This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p>",963,997,1580,15996,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Reasonable Accommodation Request and Social Anxiety Disorder,"<h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination. Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity. Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms? A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a test-case. In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following. If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul>	<li>Children under the age of fourteen (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Children under the age of eight (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of the family residence;</li>	<li>Children shall not be allowed to play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which they reside;</li>	<li>Residents under the age of eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li>	<li>Residents and visitors under the age of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy. These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning ‰ÛÒ No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol>	<li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li>	<li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li>	<li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li>	<li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine ‰ÛÒ in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li>	<li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service ‰ÛÒ disseminating information and facts ‰ÛÒ not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

""How do you get in and out of the shower?"" ""don't you need someone to take care of you?""</p><p>These are questions the average prospective tenant does not expect to hear when seeking an apartment. However, many people with developmental disabilities routinely get questions like these from housing providers. More people with developmental disabilities are living independently these days, and housing providers need to be mindful of their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act1.</p><p>What is a Developmental Disability?<br />Developmental disabilities are a diverse group of physical, cognitive, psychological, sensory, and speech conditions that begin anytime during development up to 18 years of age. About 17% of US children under 18 years of age have a developmental disability. Developmental disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism or other neurological conditions that result in limitations of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior. Some people with developmental disabilities use mobility aids such as wheelchairs, canes, or leg braces, and will require accessibility features in their dwellings, such as ramps, lever door handles, or bathroom grab bars. Others have speech disabilities and may speak very slowly or be difficult to understand. Some have sensory disabilities such as low vision or deafness. Some have learning disabilities, mental retardation or other cognitive conditions that cause their processing of information to be slower. A number of folks with developmental disabilities use the services of drop-in caregivers or live-in aides to assist them with activities of daily living (shopping, cooking, bathing, housekeeping, etc.).</p><p>Advocates<br />A number of those with developmental disabilities have an ""advocate"" who may be a relative, friend, caseworker, or other individual who assists them in dealing with complex issues. For example, an advocate may accompany the prospective tenant to view an apartment and to help interpret the rental agreement. Often, an advocate is available to assist the tenant and the housing provider if a tenancy problem should arise.</p><p>Some people with developmental disabilities may seem unsophisticated or even naive. Housing providers often mistakenly react by treating them differently than they treat other tenants. Many tenants with a developmental disability report that housing providers have asked them extremely personal questions, entered their apartments without notice, or taken advantage of their lack of sophistication.</p><p>Like other tenants with disabilities, folks with developmental disabilities may have accommodation needs; like all other tenants, this group wishes to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity.</p><p>Reasonable Modifications<br />Many people with developmental disabilities may have problems accessing their unit due to their use of wheelchairs, crutches, or other mobility devices. They may need to make alterations in their units in order to have better and / or safe access. Fair Housing laws require that housing providers permit, at the expense of the person with a disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises if necessary for the tenant's full enjoyment of the premises. For example, a tenant should be allowed to widen a doorway for wheelchair access.</p><p>A housing provider may condition permission for the modification based on the tenant agreeing to restore the unit to its original condition when the tenant vacates the unit. However, the tenant need not remove the modifications if they will not interfere with the next tenant's use and enjoyment of the unit (for instance, a wider door need not be made smaller again). The housing provider may ask that the tenant set up an interest bearing account not to exceed the amount of the modifications to cover the cost of returning the apartment or house back to its original configuration.</p><p>A tenant with a developmental disability should be permitted to make the following types of reasonable modifications: installing ramps, grab bars, audible and visual call mechanisms, widening doors and lowering cabinets. The modifications are not limited to the tenant's unit but may be requested for common areas, recreational areas, entrances to the building, laundry room and the garage. This is not an exhaustive list of the types of modifications that a tenant might request. A housing provider should review each request on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Reasonable Accommodations<br />While equal treatment is required in most respects, a housing provider has a duty to treat a tenant with a developmental disability differently with respect to reasonable accommodations. The need for reasonable accommodations can arise at the admissions stage, during the tenancy and during the eviction process. A housing provider must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when necessary to provide tenants an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. When a tenant's disability makes it difficult for him or her to comply with certain rules, the housing provider may need to provide extra help and / or extra time so that the tenant can comply. For example, as an accommodation, a housing provider can make a phone call to remind a tenant with memory problems to pay rent on the first of each month.</p><p>Tenants with developmental disabilities may request reasonable accommodations orally or in writing. Once a tenant initiates an accommodation request, the housing provider is entitled, in most cases, to a letter of verification of the existence of the tenant's disability and need for the accommodation.</p><p>There are very limited situations where a housing provider does not have to provide a requested accommodation. It is not a reasonable accommodation to tolerate a tenant who poses a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or employees of the housing provider. However, it would be a reasonable accommodation to approve a tenant's plan for acceptable minimization or elimination of the direct threat of the behavior. If the tenant fails to follow the plan and repeats the violating behaviors, the tenant may no longer be entitled to the protection of the fair housing laws.</p><p>Examples of Reasonable Accommodations:<br />- Providing a prospective tenant with a disability with assistance in filling out the rental application upon request.<br />- If asked, considering an application despite poor credit if a prospective tenant with a disability offers to have the disability check directly deposited with a payee who will ensure the rent gets paid each month.<br />- Allowing a tenant to have a live-in caregiver, irrespective of occupancy standards, upon request.<br />- Showing a tenant with developmental disability how to use the stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, door locks or fire extinguishers upon request.<br />- Reading notices to a tenant with a disability who has difficulty in reading upon request. Another option would be providing the notices in tape-recorded form or, with the tenant's permission, sending copies of the notices to his or her case manager or other support person.<br />- Granting a parking space to a tenant with a mobility disability upon request, even if the tenant does not drive but has someone drive for him or her. (It is preferable to provide a reserved space for that specific tenant and to mark it with appropriate signage designating it as accessible.)<br />- Permitting a tenant to keep a medically necessary assistance animal despite a ""no pets"" policy upon request. (Because the animal is not a pet, no deposits / fees / rent can be charged for the animal upfront; however, the housing provider can charge the same cleaning deposit it charges all other tenants. Housing providers can expect the owner to manage the animal's behavior (no constant barking, no property damage), to keep the animal under their control, and to handle the animal's waste appropriately. If the animal causes damage, the resident is financial responsible. Such animals need not be trained, ""certified,"" nor have a special identifying harness or tag.)<br />- Granting permission upon request for a tenant to add grab bars to his shower, at the tenant's expense, with the work done professionally, to code, with any required permits.<br />- Installing a ramp or widening a sidewalk upon request so a tenant can access the clubhouse. (Accessibility ramps are almost always considered reasonable and the widening of walkways would generally be considered so as well. The housing provider would be responsible for this cost unless they could demonstrate that the changes would either fundamentally alter the premises or pose an undue financial or administrative hardship on them.)<br />- Providing sufficient time when talking with a tenant who has a speech disability.<br />- When a housing provider has received complaints about the annoying behavior of a tenant, working with the tenant (and his or her advocate) when the tenant asserts that the behavior is related to his / her disability and requests that the provider negotiate a plan that will allow him / her to get assistance to remediate the problem.</p><p>Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing<br />Housing providers can promote fair housing by planning and implementing a set of fair housing policies and procedures that address reasonable modification and accommodation requirements. This would include the following:<br />1. Signs in the common area that state management's policies<br />2. An information sheet for applicants describing management's policies and procedures with regard to accommodations and modifications during applicant screening and tenancy<br />3. Policy of reviewing reasonable modification and accommodation information with each tenant along with the rental agreement; copy issued to the tenant<br />4. Forms and procedures for staff to follow when there is a situation with a tenancy that may be covered by the Fair Housing Act and local ordinances<br />5. Arranging for fair housing training for managers, maintenance staff, and other employees or contractors / vendors<br />6. When working with tenants who have developmental disabilities, keep the following in mind:<br />- It is not appropriate to ask tenants or prospective tenants if they have a disability, what medications a person is taking, or probe about the nature or severity of a disability.<br />- Not all disabilities are visible, so it is best to inform all tenants about one's fair housing policies and advise them about the availability of assistance for tenants who have disabilities.<br />- Each accommodation request must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.<br />- Housing providers may not reject an accommodation request based on a desire to treat all tenants alike. Such a request can only be rejected if it is unreasonable under the circumstances, if it will impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the provider, or if it will require a fundamental alteration of the services provided to tenants. For example, if one older building in a complex has no elevator, it might be an unreasonable cost to provide a requested elevator, when the common room services available there could be moved to another, more accessible building for much less cost.<br />- Some people with developmental disabilities live in subsidized housing, while others have section 8 vouchers and seek housing in the community, and still others rely on no subsidies at all. It should be noted that while the federal Fair Housing Act does not cover section 8 voucher holders, many local communities have fair housing ordinances that do protect them against discrimination based on section 8 and some protect other legal sources of income such as disability income.<br />- If a tenant expresses concern over possible discrimination, don't hesitate to suggest they contact their local fair housing agency.<br />- If the applicant / tenant identifies them to you, rely on their support system, including advocates, caregivers, social service workers, etc.</p><p>Remember, all tenants wish to be treated with respect and dignity. Although some people with disabilities may look or act somewhat differently than others, housing providers should treat them similar to the way other tenants are treated, with the same rights and responsibilities. It's not only the ethical thing to do, it is your legal obligation under federal, state, and local laws.</p><p>For a wealth of information on disability as a protected class, including reasonable modifications and accommodations, sample forms and policies, etc. visit <a href=""http://www.FHCO.org/disability.htm"">www.FHCO.org/disability.htm</a>.</p><p>This article brought to you by the Fair Housing Council; a nonprofit serving the state of Oregon and SW Washington.

The Oregon landlord tenant law does not expressly address this specific issue. The closest it comes are the following laws:</p><p>1. ORS 90.755 Right to speak on political issues; limitations; placement of political signs:</p><p>(1) No provision in any bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule may infringe upon the right of a person who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home to invite public officers, candidates for public office or officers or representatives of a tenant organization to appear and speak upon matters of public interest in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner in an open public meeting. The landlord of a facility, however, may enforce reasonable rules and regulations relating to the time, place and scheduling of the speakers that will protect the interests of the majority of the homeowners.</p><p>(2) The landlord shall allow the tenant to place political signs on or in a manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by the tenant or the space rented by the tenant. The size of the signs and the length of time for which the signs may be displayed are subject to the reasonable rules of the landlord. (Emphasis added.)</p><p>2. 90.750 Right to assemble or canvass in facility; limitations. No provision contained in any bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule pertaining to a facility shall:</p><p>(1) Infringe upon the right of persons who rent spaces in a facility to peaceably assemble in an open public meeting for any lawful purpose, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility. Reasonable times shall include daily the hours between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.</p><p>(2) Infringe upon the right of persons who rent spaces in a facility to communicate or assemble among themselves, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of discussing any matter, including but not limited to any matter relating to the facility or manufactured dwelling or floating home living. The discussions may be held in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility, including halls or centers, or any resident's dwelling unit or floating home. The landlord of a facility, however, may enforce reasonable rules and regulations including but not limited to place, scheduling, occupancy densities and utilities.</p><p>(3) Prohibit any person who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home from canvassing other persons in the same facility for purposes described in this section. As used in this subsection, ""canvassing"" includes door-to-door contact, an oral or written request, the distribution, the circulation, the posting or the publication of a notice or newsletter or a general announcement or any other matter relevant to the membership of a tenants' association.</p><p>(4) This section is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to solicit money, except that a tenants' association member, whether or not a tenant of the facility, may personally collect delinquent dues owed by an existing member of a tenants' association.</p><p>(5) This section is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to disregard a tenant's request not to be canvassed. (Emphasis added.)</p><p>3. 90.740 Tenant obligations. A tenant shall:</p><p>(3) Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in compliance with the rental agreement and with any laws or ordinances that relate to the tenant's behavior as a tenant.</p><p>(4) Except as provided by the rental agreement:</p><p>(a) Use the rented space and the facility common areas in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended;</p><p>(i) Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors. (Emphasis added.)</p><p>So, you see, this simply isn'taddressed in the landlord-tenant law. Nor should it be. Clearly, the resident leaving the religious material in the clubhouse could, if he or she wanted, go door to door proselytizing, unless and until others complained. If the materials are left anonymously, without more than a single resident being offended, I'm not sure what the landlord could or should do. Remove and destroy the materials?</p><p>If the landlord knows who is doing this, perhaps a personal discussion with them might be in order. But telling them to ""stop"" because a single person is offended seems unnecessary. If there is a place in the clubhouse for storage of reading materials, perhaps removing the literature to that location would work. Certainly, no rule change prohibiting placement of materials in the clubhouse (just because they are religious) is unnecessary. Management cannot be responsible for controlling the placement of written materials in the clubhouse unless it is offensive, inappropriate for minors and guests. This is what free speech is all about. My view would be the same regardless of the denomination of the literature. If I'm incorrect, I'm sure I will hear about it.</p><br>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1335283272,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13414,"<p align=""center""><strong><u>Oregon Rent Increase Laws In Manufactured Housing Communities</u></strong></p><p><strong><em>Question No. 1. </em></strong> >If a resident in a manufactured housing community is on a two-year lease, when may the landlord increase rent?</p>",963,997,1580,16514,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Rent!

Rent is set in the lease, and (hopefully) the landlord has built into the document a rent increase formula (e.g. a ""base"" amount plus a percentage increase tied to some recognized index, e.g. the CPI, or Consumer Price Index).  Not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the lease term, the landlord must give written notice of the terms of the new lease (including rent), and may include new rules, etc., so long as they are all consistent with the terms of the leases and rules given to new incoming residents. See, <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.545"">ORS 90.545</a>.</p><br><p>Rent for periodic tenancies, such as month-to-month, can only increase through a 90-day notice, pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.600"">ORS 90.600</a>. Note that this statute limits its application to ""month to month tenancies"", so a landlord with a fixed term tenancy <em><u>cannot</u></em> use that statute to increase rent for a fixed term tenancy.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p><br><p><strong><em>Question No. 2.  </em></strong>Can a landlord raise rent in the first year of the lease, or does he/she have to wait a year?

The state law cannot interfere with that contractually agreed-upon arrangement.  So you don't have to figure out a work-around for leases - just build in a good formula to cover the years of the lease term.</p><p><br /><strong><em>Question No. 3.</em></strong> What about rent increases in the Portland metro area? What are the limitations? </p><p><br /><strong><em>Answer.  </em></strong>Originally, the Portland rent increase law as it applied to rental homes, apartments, and RVs, contained the one year limitation discussed above. But in 2016, <a href=""https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2016R1/Measures/Overview/HB4143"">HB 4143 </a>was enacted, which expanded the one-year limitation statewide.

The big exception is for the city of Portland, in which increases of 10% or more have some rather harsh financial consequences to landlords.</p><br><p>Advance notice of increase requirements or rent increase limitations do not apply if the tenant is on a lease (unless provided in the lease itself), since both parties agreed, in advance, to the rent formula in the written document.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><br><p><br /><br /> </p><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> However, notwithstanding the limited application of ORS 90.600, I personally believe that a landlord may (with assistance of competent counsel) include in a lease, a program, not unlike that contained in ORS 90.600, providing that the rent may be increased, say annually, with 90-days' notice, in an amount not to exceed X% of base rent, thus giving the landlord the ability to vary rent increases not tied to an index, but rather to the landlord's business needs. </p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> Be careful here!

Can we continue to use the regular MHCO forms that we use for our park residents who own their own homes?</p>",963,997,1580,15762,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Renting Home & Documentation,"<p>Answer: This is a good - and important - question. Here are some points to always remember: 1. A resident who is renting the home is not under the manufactured housing section of Oregon's residential landlord-tenant law (""ORLTA"") which is contained in ORS Chapter 90. This means that you do not treat non-owner residents the same way you would as if they were renting an apartment or home. Landlord and tenant rights, duties and remedies are different, depending upon whether the person renting the space also owns the home. 2. A landlord's remedies [e.g. for-cause termination, etc.] against a non-owner resident are found in ORS 90.392, 90.394, 90.396, 90.398, 90.403 and 90.405; they are not found in the manufactured housing section of ORLTA, which commences at ORS 90.505. 3. Similarly, you do not want to use a standard manufactured dwelling space rental agreement for a non-owner resident. However, due to the number of park-owned homes, MHCO has developed a space rental agreement for tenants who do not own the home. You should use it. If you use MHCO's standard manufactured home space rental agreement for persons owning their home, you will be contractually giving the non-owner resident greater rights than you would otherwise need to do. For example, the ""cure period"" for violations is much shorter for non-owner tenants - because they only need to vacate with their personal property. They do not need to move a home. If they owned the home, they would have a 30-day right to cure under ORS 90.630. This means that you will have to use a different, non-MHCO form for rules violations by non-owner tenants. 4. However, the eviction process, i.e. the filing and service of an FED Complaint under ORS 105.105, et. seq, is the same. That is, the process of the ""first appearance,"" trial settings, etc. is exactly the same. 5. Importantly, since the park owns the home, the park is the ""landlord."" This means that it must provide inside the home certain safety measures that ORLTA requires of landlords, such as smoke detectors and [if there is a carbon monoxide source] a carbon monoxide detector. Some counties require a carbon monoxide detector in all cases, even if there is no carbon monoxide source, e.g. a gas fireplace. Go to the State Fire Marshall's site for more information on these important issues.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1363200263,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13425,"<br><p><strong><em>Question</a>:</em></strong>  Can management require of a resident selling their home in the community that the space be removed of all attachments and outbuildings that were added upon initial occupancy?

That statute is quite useful in these situations. It provides that you can give the resident a 30-day notice of termination based upon repair or deterioration issues. Depending on the degree of repair work necessary, the resident can request additional time.</p><br><p>While it is probably true that the resident may not want to do the work, if and when a purchaser is found, you may give that notice to the purchaser.  Putting the home up for sale will not extend the compliance period. Thus, in giving the notice to the prospective purchaser, the issue becomes one of negotiation between seller and buyer. If they reach agreement (which will likely include some price concessions), if the work cannot be completed before the pending transaction closes, you can include completion deadline in the new rental agreement. The new purchaser cannot take possession without first signing the rental agreement and committing to a completion date.</p><br><p>Does all this mean that you cannot or should not develop a resale compliance form for your community? No. But to be forewarned is to be forearmed. In other words, an existing resident could push back if they did not like the provisions, and they might win that argument. The work-around, is that you should make sure your rental agreement contains a good set of screening criteria. MHCO's is very complete. And if the home is in need of repair, you can always issue a 90.632 notice, and secure compliance either from the existing resident, or their prospective purchaser. Since you can make this a condition of acceptance of the prospective purchaser, and it will be written into the new rental agreement, I submit that you will be holding the better hand.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1469630181,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,357,"<p>Question: I have a resident who was given permission to build a permanent carport. Most all of the carports in my park are free standing and permanent which is my preference.

Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property. I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport. This would not have been an issue had the buyer is now planned on moving the home. I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as personal property along with the home. He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well. What are my rights here?</p>",963,997,1580,15756,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Builds Carport - Sells Home - New Owner Wants to Take Home and Carport,"<p>Answer: This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws. First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the ""space"" as the ""premises."" For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space. In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence. It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started. You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place. What about permits? It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with. I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are ""free standing and permanent."" If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed. However, your independent conclusion that a structure is ""permanent"" and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe? It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came. While your opinion is important, so is that of your resident. For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules. Some of the things that should be covered are the following: - Code compliance - Management pre-approval of completed drawings - Time to complete work - Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor - Method of affixing to the ground - Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off - Who owns the structure - Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest ""yes"" so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.) - Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition - remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park. In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit. I really can't disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition. That's about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules - or at least agreed-upon terms - before construction commences again, is a good idea.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1373600788,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,399,"<p>Question: A tenant was convicted of a sex crime - molesting his granddaughters.

What Can Be Done To Prevent This?,"<p>Answer: I assume when he was first accepted as a resident he did not have a criminal record for any sex offenses. The statute that comes into play is ORS 90.630 (Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent.) It provides, in part: "" ... the landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy for space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home by giving to the tenant not less than 30 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant: (c) Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587;"" This statute has only been in existence for a few years. As I read it, assuming that at the commencement of the tenancy, a landlord ran a criminal background check on a prospective resident and nothing showed him to be a sex offender - and they he later committed a sexual offence - you can evict them at as soon as you find out. In this case, it would seem that you can exclude him on that basis alone. Had this law been on the books when he committed the crime, and he didn'tgo to jail, you could have evicted him at the time. Now that it's on the books, I think you have the same right to keep him out, i.e. to protect the residents' visiting grandchildren. The only issue is whether he is  '_a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587.""

Based on their combined credit scores, they were both approved for residency. They have since divorced and one of them has moved out. How do we deal with this?</p><p>We have several questions listed below.</p>",963,997,1580,15746,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Couple Divorces - One Moves Out - How to Document,"<p>Answer: First, please understand that Oregon law does not directly deal with this - and neither is it addressed in most rental/lease agreements, including MHCO's. So my responses are based upon my opinion alone. Until an appellate court rules on these issues - which is unlikely, since most such cases are never appealed - the best we can do is speculate. My answers are in italics below.</p><p>1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</p><p><em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident - even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in. A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p><p>2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?</p><p><em>Technically, yes. Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can - without your consent - alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed. [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p><p>3. Do we rescreen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?</p><p><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so - if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what? Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years? Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can - or will make the payments? That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced. Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved. The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent's individual credit score less important. The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse. It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.</em></p><p>4. If we do rescreen the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?</p><p><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above. If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing - and I have never seen any that do - the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge. I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so. A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria - with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules - would be a very difficult sell to most judges. It is unlikely that you would prevail. I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out. If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict. But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent in the future, is premature and likely to fail. </em></p><p>5. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?</p><p><em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease. It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy. If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them.</em></p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1329150523,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13018,"<p><strong><em>Question: </em></strong>What can a landlord do about resident's who deliberately leave water running in the summer to get back at the landlord?<br /> </p>",963,997,1580,16118,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Deliberately Wasting Water - What Can I Do?,"<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.6;""><em>Answer:   </em></strong><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">First, there is nothing in the Oregon Residential landlord-tenant law directly on point.

Your question doesn'tmake it clear whether the estate was formally filed for probate in court, in which case this ""Administrator"" would be subject to court supervision and would have to have a bond.  I'm suspecting that is not the case - but if it is, you may want to secure legal counsel to notify the court of what's happening and perhaps get him removed.</p><p> </p><p>Assuming that the person is just a designee for the un-probated estate (I will call him the ""representative""), I would suggest that you look to ORS 90.675(20), which applies when a resident living alone passes away.  Subsection (20) is summarized below, but should not be used as a substitute for reading ORS 90.675 <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.675"">(linked here)</a> in its entirety:</p><p> </p><ul>	<li >This subsection (20) applies the same duties as those of a resident who abandoned the property.</li>	<li >It also applies to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court, or any person designated in writing by the decedent to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death;</li>	<li >The 45-day abandonment notice required in ORS 90.675(3) (go to above link) is to be sent by first class mail to this representative at the premises, and also personally delivered or sent by first class mail to them if actually known to the landlord.</li>	<li >If the representative responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided in the letter and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later.</li>	<li ><strong><em><u>Note:</u></em></strong><em>  Entering into the storage agreement includes the duty to pay a ""storage fee"" which can be no higher than the space rent. This duty is not triggered until the 45-day letter is sent.  Presumably you will use a good storage agreement that requires, among other things, compliance with all applicable park rules and state, federal and local laws and ordinances, including a duty to maintain the space.  On- site destruction of the home is NOT maintaining the space.  Depending upon the home's age, on site destruction could be a violation of certain environmental laws, due to potentially hazardous material used in construction.  In fact, since there is a risk that the representative will not comply with the storage agreement - based on his threat of destruction - you may want to consider - only upon the advice of your attorney - to restrict his unsupervised access to the home.  Destruction of the home would not only take it off the tax rolls in violation of Oregon property tax law, but it would prevent you, as the landlord, from selling the home upon failure of the representative to meet his obligations.  Remember, in addition to the tax collector, you have a vested interest in seeing the home sold for recoupment any sums due (arguably including attorney fees) incurred during the abandonment process.</em></li>	<li >Since the abandonment law requires that the landlord has a duty of safe keeping pending completion of the abandonment process, it is my <u>belief</u><a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> that this entitles the landlord to secure the home (e.g. with a new lock) so that heirs and others cannot enter and remove personal property.</li>	<li >A storage agreement entitles the representative to store the personal property on the space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>	<li >If such an agreement is entered into, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder (if any) until the agreement with the representative ends.</li>	<li >If the representative requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement and there is a lienholder, also, you should review subsections (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of ORS 90.675, which describes the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</li>	<li >During the term of the Storage Agreement, the representative has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir who wishes to leave the property on the space and become a tenant.

The resident claims to have a medical marijuana card. What are my rights as a community owner? Can I ask to see the card? Does the card have to be current?

Can I give the resident who is growing the marijuana a 30 day notice for disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of other residents due to the odor?</p>",963,997,1580,15714,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Growing Marijuana Plants,"<p>Answer: This is a very complicated issue on several levels. For example, marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law. Under Oregon law, use and cultivation in limited amounts pursuant to a lawful Medical Marijuana Card are legal. The Oregon laws are linked here. The statutes cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder's immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana. For those interested, these statutes should be consulted. You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park's rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act. I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident. The main issue here is Fair Housing Laws. If the resident has a valid card, then arguably he have some medical condition that has authorized its issuance. Does he have a legal right to demand that under the Fair Housing Laws, you make a ""reasonable accommodation"" for his medical condition, and permit him to continue in his grow operation? Not necessarily. In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was ""Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing."" While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful - though perhaps not a ""final"" resource - on the issue. It is very complete and helpful for all park managers and owners. It can be downloaded at: https://www.google.com/search?q=hud%20medical%20marijuana. Here is what the Memo directs: Public housing agencies  '_in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users. The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department."" Thus, HUD seems to be skirting the issue, leaving it up to the agency in the state that permits the use of medical marijuana. Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not enforce a fair housing reasonable accommodation claim against park ownership or management if the community has an anti-marijuana policy in place. Without such a policy, my inclination is that enforcement would be potentially riskier, since the card-holder was not aware of the limitation at the inception of the tenancy. In answer to your specific questions: - Clearly, the card has to be valid and current in Oregon. A California card, for example would not suffice. (See, State v. Berrenger, 2010). - If there is no card, or no current valid card, the growing (not use) of marijuana could be is a violation of state law. You may not be able to issue a 24-hour notice under ORS 90.396, since possession of certain amounts of marijuana pursuant to a valid card, is protected. However, you may consider issuances of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630; - If others are complaining about the odor, you have an issue between enforcing the use and enjoyment provisions of your rules or ORS 90.740(4)(i) versus permitting the activity if the resident has a lawfully issued Oregon card and is not growing over the proscribed amount. In any event, I would recommend that your community institute a medical marijuana use policy as a part of your rules and regulations. See, ORS 90.610 for the law regarding rule changes. Note that the right to implement a rule change - even if it results and a material change to the tenant's bargain with the park - is expressly permitted. In other words, you may want to proscribe ALL such activity, even if it pre-existed the new rule. Alternatively, you could grandfather in current card-holders.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1381248981,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,410,"<p>Following last week's article on the issue of marijuana cultivation in a manufactured housing community, I received, compliments of John VanLandingham, some good resource materials that I'd like to pass along.</p>",963,997,1580,15711,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Growing Marijuana Plants - Follow Up and Additional Resources,"<p>Readers of my article will note that my focus was primarily on the federal laws. This was because during my research, I was directed by the Oregon Health Authority (here) to the federal HUD website. However, as John points out,  '_Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law."" So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes Oregon law. John directed me to the 2010 Oregon case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, which addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in this state. The answers contained in that case represent the most current state of medical marijuana law in Oregon both from an employment and housing perspective. John, as a board member of Fair Housing Council of Oregon (""FHCO""), also directed me to the following FHCO article [authored after the Emerald Steel Fabricators case], which serves as a good resource on the issue of medical marijuana use in Oregon. The FHCO article can be found here. Keep in mind that the law is still developing, so you should consult your own legal counsel on these issues. These MHCO articles should not be relied upon as legal advice. So, to incorporate these resources into my prior answer, here are some ""take-away"" points for park owners and managers on the issue of usage and cultivation of medical marijuana in Oregon manufactured housing communities: - If the resident insists that you make a reasonable accommodation for them because their use is due to a disability, you may say ""N0."" Note, however, park residents still have the right to ask for a reasonable accommodation. - Owners and managers may not deny an applicant housing availability simply because they have, or intend to obtain, a medical marijuana card [any more than management may deny tenancy to a person who says he or she has a disability]. - To reiterate what I said in last week's article, it is my opinion that park management should institute a medical marijuana policy in the rules, dealing both with the use and cultivation of the substance inside the community. It is not a fair housing violation to prohibit it in the rules. However, if legal use or cultivation [i.e. according to Oregon state law] occurs in a community, and there are no express prohibitions against doing so, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for the activity, unless it violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1381879155,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13180,"<p><strong>Question. </strong>A resident living alone is in a coma in the hospital.

Most all of the carports in our park are free standing and permanent which is my preference. However, he constructed the permanent carport by boring holes in the ground and filling them with concrete and inserting metal mounts to which he fastened 4x4 uprights for the carport. Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property. I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport. This would not have been an issue had the buyer not planned on moving the home. I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as movable personal property along with the home. He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well. What are my rights here?</p>",963,997,1580,15734,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Improvements and Building Code Compliance,"<p>Answer: This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws. First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the ""space"" as the ""premises."" For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space. In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence. It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started. You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place. What about permits? It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with. I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are ""free standing and permanent."" If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed. However, your independent conclusion that a structure is ""permanent"" and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe? It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came. The same issues pertain to the new buyer. While your opinion is important, so are those of your resident and his buyer. For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules. Some of the things that should be covered are the following: - Code compliance - Management pre-approval of completed drawings - Time to complete work - Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor - Method of affixing to the ground - Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off - Who owns the structure upon completion? - Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest ""yes"" so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.) - Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition - remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park. In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit. I really can't disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition. That's about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules - or at least agreed-upon terms - before construction commences again, is a good idea.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1400252250,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13223,"<p><strong>Question. </strong>What do you do when you discover a resident has filed for bankruptcy after you have given them a 72 hour notice for nonpayment of rent?

We had a situation come up recently that we would like your opinion on. With this particular lease, rent is due on the 1st and a late fee is assessed if not received by midnight of the 5th. We send 72-hour notices on the 8th of the month at the earliest. In this situation, a tenant has purposely over-paid rent on a number of payments in order to build up a credit balance with us. He has accrued several late fees that have been assessed due to late payments after the 5th of the month - but before a 72 hour notice is ever sent. We recently deducted the accrued late fees from the credit balance he had built up. Because there was still a credit balance showing on his account after deducting the late fees, we did not send him any further notices about the late fees being assessed or deducted. He is now claiming that it was illegal to deduct the late fees from the credit balance without our sending him a notice or invoice. Your thoughts?</p>",963,997,1580,15749,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Over Pays Rent - How to Account for Late Fees,"<p>Answer. It is unclear if there ever was an actual agreement between landlord and tenant that the overpayments were to be applied toward late fees. For purposes of this question, I will assume there was an understanding of sorts [what tenant intentionally overpays, without a reason?], but presumably not in writing; hence, this dispute. The lack of any written agreement invites an argument as to how the credits were to be applied. There is an argument this was ""prepaid rent"" under ORS 90.100(33) (Definitions). Prepaid rent is a payment for rent not yet due. Prepaid rent is treated much like a security deposit, and must be accounted for at the end of the tenancy. See, ORS 90.300 (Security Deposits; Prepaid Rent). Rent [prepaid or otherwise] cannot be applied to such things as fees or deposits. See, ORS 100(35) (Definitions). In this situation, without a written agreement specifically defining what the prepayments were, and how they were to be applied, I would say the tenant may have an argument that without his consent, the money could not be applied to anything except a rent that is already due. In other words, you may not apply the monies to non-rent charges. The landlord-tenant statutes don't specifically address this type of situation, so it's a toss-up whether the practice was legal or illegal. [I assume that your rental agreement specifies whether late fees must be assessed in writing. Typically, no writing is required - the fees just become due within a certain period of time.] In any event, I don't think this is arrangement is a good practice without having it in writing. In the future, if both landlord and tenant want to continue the practice, it should be in writing and specifically address: (a) What the payments are; (b) When, how and under what circumstances they may be applied; (c) Whether any prior notice and/or written accounting is necessary; and (d) Whether interest will accrue to the tenant for the monies held by the landlord before they are applied.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1357857269,1402808456,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13143,"<br><p><strong>Question</strong> - A rent increase notice of $20 was sent out last year and became effective October 1, 2015.

Here is a summary of the tenant duties under ORS 90.325: - Use the parts of the premises including the living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and dining room in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended. - Keep all areas of the premises under control of the tenant in every part as clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin, as the condition of the premises permits and to the extent that the tenant is responsible for causing the problem. The tenant shall cooperate to a reasonable extent in assisting the landlord in any reasonable effort to remedy the problem. - Dispose from the dwelling unit all ashes, garbage, rubbish and other waste in a clean, safe and legal manner. With regard to needles, syringes and other infectious waste, as defined in ORS 459.386, the tenant may not dispose of these items by placing them in garbage receptacles or in any other place or manner except as authorized by state and local governmental agencies. - Keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the tenant as clean as their condition permits. - Use in a reasonable manner all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other facilities and appliances including elevators in the premises. - Test at least once every six months and replace batteries as needed in any smoke alarm, smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm provided by the landlord and notify the landlord in writing of any operating deficiencies. - Behave and require other persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave in a manner that will not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors. The underscored portion above clearly applies. The next question is the right of access. That is covered in ORS 90.322. The statute is quite long and complicated. Here is a summary of the relevant portions applicable to your situation: - A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord's agent may enter into the tenant's dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant's exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors. The right of access of the landlord or landlord's agent is limited as follows: - In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant's absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered. - If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord's agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant's absence or without the tenant's consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant's written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant's written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord's agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs. - A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter. - If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages. You have two choices in this situation: (a) Declare an emergency and enter to remediate the problem, carefully following the provisions of the access statute; (b) Try to secure the tenant's consent to have an exterminator enter and remediate the problem; (c) Terminate the tenancy and then fix the problem. Note that if you seek consent and the tenant refuses, you cannot then enter under the emergency provisions of the law, since the tenant has already refused access. As for damages, yes you can recover the cost, assuming that the exterminator confirms that this was a tenant caused problem.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1374984072,1402808487,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13537,"<p> </p><p><strong>Question:  </strong>In regards to rules changes, I see two problematic scenarios: (1) Parks that post a new rule in a common area that either overrides an existing rule or is an additional rule not covered in residents' current rules and regs; and (2) Parks that send residents a new set of rules and regs without providing any notice about resident opportunity to object to such new rules and regs.

There is a lot to remember. Generally all of the answers are contained in ORS 90.630 [Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent]. Here is a short summary: - The landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy in a manufactured housing community by giving not less than 30 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant: _ Violates a law or ordinance related to the tenant's conduct as a tenant, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with ORS 90.740 [Tenant Obligations]; _ Violates a rule or rental agreement provision; _ Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587; or _ Fails to pay a (i) a late charge pursuant to ORS 90.260; (ii) A fee pursuant to ORS 90.302; or (iii) a utility or service charge pursuant to ORS 90.534 or 90.536. - The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the violation within the 30-day period specified in notice of violation. However, if substantially the same act or omission recurs within six months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy upon at least 20 days' written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy. In such cases, the tenant does not have a right to correct the violation - and the notice must so state. - Oregon's ""three strikes"" law only applies to cases in which the tenant is issued three 72-hour [or 144-hour] notices within a 12-month period. [Caveat: All three notices must have been validly prepared and delivered or served. - PCQ] The ""three strikes"" law is found at ORS 90.630(8)-(10). As noted above, multiple violations of the same or similar rule within six months can result in the landlord's issuance of a non-curable 20-day notice to the tenant.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1367511423,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13201,"<p><strong>Question.  </strong>What is the difference between the enforceability of our rules vs our rental agreement?

So for example, while the rental agreement may require that tenants conduct themselves in such a manner as to preserve their neighbor's quiet enjoyment of their spaces, the rules may address more specifics of this duty, such as lawn mowing, leaf blowing, loud parties, etc.</li>	<li>I frequently see much unnecessary overlap in rules and rental agreements, e.g. covering the same things, or covering them inconsistently. This is unfortunate, since it can create confusion among tenants. My rule of thumb would be that in the event of an inconsistency, you should not try to enforce a specific prohibition in one of the documents, if the other is more lenient. Or to put it another way, in the event of two provisions addressing the same issue, landlords should enforce the more lenient of them.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:-4.5pt;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:-4.5pt;""> </p><br><br><br><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> There are several exceptions relating to changes which, for example, permit landlords to take advantage of newer statutes that give rights not formerly described by the law or found in rental agreements, such as the right to submeter spaces, etc.</p></div></div>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1470572346,1534198260,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13558,"<br><p><strong>Question:  </strong>Are RVs in RV parks exempt under the rent control law, or am I limited to issuing 'for cause' notices for violators in my RV park who have been there over a year?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16658,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: RVs in RV Park Under the New Rent Control Law,"<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  RVs are not treated the same as manufactured homes.

And if our community percentage is 85%, are we required to rent the 15% remainder to families with children?</p>",963,997,1580,15752,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Safe Margin for 80-20 Rule in 55 and Older Communities,"<p>Answer: You must have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical. Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% occupancy [even upon death of a qualifying 55+ resident] means immediate disqualification. Does this mean that your 15% safety margin must be reserved for families with children? The answer is ""No."" In fact, a 55+ community should strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over. Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age? Again, the answer is ""No."" If desired, a 55+ community may impose a minimum age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years. However, it is also important for you to publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to operate as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory; i.e. you should make sure that in all advertising, rules, rental agreements, and policies, you always hold the community out as a 55+ facility. Lastly, you must comply with HUD's age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that at least 80% of the community is intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver's license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1350848045,1402808968,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12782,"<p>Question: We have various screening criteria, but they change from time to time -- usually after we run up against a problem we haven't seen before. Is it OK to change our criteria, and if so, how do we do it?</p>",963,997,1580,15882,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Screening Applicants - Is It Okay to Change Criteria? Any Changes in Oregon Law?,"<p>Answer: The tenant application process is one of the least understood by landlords and managers. This lack of familiarity can result in significant liability to park owners. Here is a short primer:</p><p>Screening Criteria. The manufactured housing section of Oregon's landlord-tenant law provides that any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser who will live in the community should be disclosed in the existing resident's rental or lease agreement.(1) Although those conditions must be in conformance with state and federal laws, there are no limitations or restrictions as to what criteria may be placed in the rental or lease agreement.</p><p>If you are changing your screening criteria for existing residents, you may be in violation of Oregon law, since those criteria are supposed to already be in the rental agreement, which, as you know, cannot be unilaterally amended by a landlord - subject only to specific exceptions.</p><p>MHCO's rental (Form 5A) and lease agreement (Form 5B) forms contain a number of criteria that landlords may impose, such as: (a) prior rental references; (b) unsatisfactory credit history or no credit history; (c) character references; (d) criminal history; (e) insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly space rent and other expense obligations imposed by the rental or lease agreement; (f) the presence, number and size of pets; (g) age verification criteria if the park is a 55+ facility; (h) evidence of falsified or misleading material information; (i) refusal to sign a written lease or rental agreement; (j) additional occupants; and (k) adverse public record information.</p><p>Note that in 2013, the Oregon Legislature changed the law as it relates to ""criminal history."" Now, landlords and managers may not summarily reject a prospective tenant for ""any"" criminal history. Today, it is limited to:</p><p>- Pending criminal charges, or<br />- Prior criminal convictions, if they resulted from crimes that are:<br />o Drug-related;<br />o Against persons;<br />o Sexual in nature;<br />o Fraudulent in nature; or<br />o That could adversely affect the property, health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the landlord, landlord's agents, or tenants.</p><p>To remind landlords and managers, MHCO will be adding these clarifications to its rental and lease agreement forms. In the meantime, landlords and managers should adhere to the new limitations described above.</p><p>Although there may be other criteria that landlords and managers may wish to use when deciding whether to accept an applicant, the above list in the MHCO form is very comprehensive, and should be sufficient in imposing adequate guidelines when a resident wishes to sell their home on site. If you want to make a change by adding additional screening criteria, you may only do so for new residents coming into the community - not retroactively for existing residents.</p><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms. Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check providing necessary verification. Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day or 10-day period (2) within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does not prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees. Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day or 10-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate. Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted application if it is incomplete - and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned. Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided incorrect information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><p>Conclusion. Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes. Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly can result in the process becoming rushed. Landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them. Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed. Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws when one applicant claims they were treated differently than another.</p><p>1 Although the law provides that the screening criteria must be in the rental or lease agreement, they may also be found in the rules and regulations. While there is no problem with this, other than redundancy, landlords should be careful to make sure that the criteria are the same. Similarly, the criteria may also be put in the Statement of Policy, but similar caution should be exercised to make them consistent. My approach is however, to avoid the risk of inconsistency by not repeating the same requirements in multiple documents. If one document gets changed and the others don't there will be an inconsistency.</p><p>2 The longer period exists if the tenant failed to give the landlord at least 10-days advance notice of intent to sell his/her home.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1404674279,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13025,"<br><p><strong><em>Question. </em></strong>We have a tenant that rents one of our Studio Apartments, recently she requested to rent one of our mobile homes that just became vacant.

While the law says that landlords are not required to accept Section 8 tenants, landlords may not refuse to rent because their source of income is a Section 8 voucher, or any other local, state, or federal housing assistance program. However, an applicant's (a) past conduct or (b) inability to pay rent, may be taken into consideration, so long as the landlord's screening protocols are consistent with local, state and federal laws. Landlords must include the <em>value of the applicant's housing assistance</em> when evaluating their ability to pay rent. See, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/659A.421"">ORS 659A.421(2)(a)</a></p><br><p>The Section 8 voucher program is a federally program available throughout Oregon. According to Sybil's article above:</p><br><p> '_the program is not achieving its goals: too many tenants struggle to find places where their vouchers will be accepted, and fear of administrative issues causes landlord reluctance to participate. As a result, families have fewer choices and face barriers to success. When vouchers are not accepted, the important public purpose of the housing assistance program is undermined, and the stability of low-income families is threatened.

The local housing authority does perform an inspection of the residence. </p><br><p>As for any required repairs, Sybil's above article includes the following discussion by <strong>Jim Straub, Legislative Director for </strong><a href=""http://www.oregonrentalhousing.com/"">Oregon Rental Housing Association</a><strong>:</strong></p><br><p>""Do you have the right to refuse to make repairs without running afoul of the new law? Clearly we are not talking about minor repairs here. If Section 8 requires you to change a broken light bulb or replace a broken switch cover, no reasonable person would see that as a reason to refuse to move forward with the tenancy. Likewise, this isn'tyour opportunity to object to the entire law and simply decide ahead of time you aren'tgoing to make any repairs, then refuse to rent to the otherwise-qualified applicant after the Section 8 inspection. If you did that, the applicant could sue you under the law and, frankly, most any judge will see that as a transparent attempt to use your refusal as a tool for non-participation in the Section 8 process. I'm thinking more of a landlord who, based on Section 8's exterior paint standards, is asked to repaint their entire property prior to renting to the Section 8 applicant. For some landlords on a budget, especially if we're talking about pre-1978 paint that requires lead-based paint remediation methods, this Section 8 requirement could be entirely cost prohibitive. What happens then? That's a good question, and no one really knows the answer right now. What I will say is that if you have an otherwise-qualified Section 8 applicant who you decide NOT to rent to based on a refusal to comply with Section 8's inspection requirements, be sure you have valid reasons for not making the repairs and moving forward with the tenancy. If you are sued, you will stand in front of a judge and have to justify your decision. If you choose this route, make sure you can defend your reasons for refusing to make the repairs. ""I didn'tthink I should have to"" is probably not going to</p><br><p>Probably the biggest thing you want to look for when Section 8 makes inspection repair requirements is whether the recommendation is a habitability issue.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> You, of course, don't ever want to refuse to repair a problem that is a habitability concern. Worse, however, would be to have a habitability problem ""on the record"" for your property that you refuse to repair and then proceed to rent the property to someone else. If injury or damage is caused to those new tenants by the habitability problem, they will be able to make the case that you knew of the problem and rented the property anyway. I can't think of a faster way to lose a lawsuit than this.""</p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion.  </em></strong>Here is the take=away from my perspective:  It does not appear that the local Section 8 housing authority will require you to perform repairs that would not otherwise be imposed upon you by Oregon's habitability requirements.

Can you explain the new law?</p>",963,997,1580,15720,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Selling a home in your park acquired through abandonment without having to hire a mortgage broker. Can you explain the new law?,"<p>Answer: I assume you are referring to a sale where you carry back the security obligation (as opposed to the buyer paying cash or securing third party financing). In this respect, you are correct, subject to several limitations. MHCO worked extensively with the Oregon Department of Finance and Corporate Securities (""DFCS"") and others to develop an exemption to the Oregon law that would permit park owners to engage in the sale of formerly abandoned homes to purchasers for the purpose of a primary residence without having to use a broker (referred to as a ""Mortgage Loan Originator"" or ""MLO"" under the new law). Here is a summary of the new exemption law which will be found in ORS 86A.203. - Here are the rules for those licensed as a manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.691. _ They may offer or negotiate the terms of the loan three or fewer times in a 12 month period; _ They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules . _ The dealer may not hold more than eight residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means ""at one time.""] - Here are the rules for those licensed as a limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.706. _ They may offer or negotiate terms of the loan five or fewer times in a 12 month period: _ They must have an ownership interest in a manufactured dwelling park; _ They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules. _ They may not hold more than twelve residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means ""at one time.""] But here's the rest of the story: Just because you are exempted from the MLO licensing requirements for a limited number of sales, does not mean that you are free from the tentacles of the Dodd-Frank Act. No, indeed. In fact, there are two new rules that still will apply. 1. Ability-to-Repay (""ATR"") Rules. A creditor is prohibited from making a residential loan (this includes your sale of the formerly abandoned home) unless it first makes  '_a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for ""qualified mortgages."" [See CFPB Summary, here.] In complying with the ATR rules, you must consider and verify the following borrower information: a) Current or reasonably expected income or assets [other than the value of the home that secures the loan]; b) Current employment status; c) Monthly payment on the mortgage loan; d) Monthly payment on any simultaneous mortgage loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know will be made; e) Monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations [e.g., insurance, taxes, assessments]; f) Current debt obligations; g) Monthly debt-to-income ratio, or residual income; and h) Credit history. In making the loan you will be required to calculate the mortgage loan payment based on: - The fully indexed rate or any introductory interest rate (whichever is greater); and - Substantially equal monthly installment that will fully amortize the loan amount over the loan term. At first blush, perhaps these requirements don't seem so burdensome, since one would think any smart lender would follow these protocols anyway. But remember, back in the easy money days, lenders were not keeping most of their loans on their own books; instead, the loans were ""securitized"", i.e. bundled and sold as securities to investors all over the world. This meant that circa 2004 - 2008, the originating banks that funded these residential loans were quickly repaid by investors and were never going to have to deal with them if and when they failed. Hence, bank underwriting was virtually nonexistent back then - except, of course, for those loans the banks were going to keep on their own books (sometimes referred to as ""portfolio loans""). 2. Qualified Mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act has established a term, ""Qualified Mortgage,"" or ""QM,"" that provides a safe harbor for lenders. That is, if the loan is a QM, there is a legal presumption that the lender complied with the ATR underwriting rules, and therefore the penalties for non-compliance are either eliminated or substantially reduced, as discussed below. If a presumption is ""conclusive,"" no amount of evidence to the contrary will defeat it. But if a presumption is ""rebuttable,"" the party opposing the presumption has an opportunity to rebut it by introducing evidence to the contrary. For a mortgage to be a ""Qualified Mortgage,"" it must meet the following requirements: - All of the ""Non-Traditional"" Loan Features Must be Removed - This refers to features that we saw in the past, e.g. negative amortization, interest-only payments, and certain balloon payments.[5] - The loan may not exceed 30 years. - If the loan is for $100,000 or more, it cannot have points or fees greater than 3% of the total loan amount. There are different and stricter limits for smaller loans. Certain ""bona fide discount points"" for prime loans are not included in these limits. - There is an Income Verification and Monthly Debt-to-Income Ratio Cap; The borrower's total monthly debt-to-income ratio (i.e. all housing and non-housing expenses, such as food, automobile, child care, etc.) can be no greater than 43%. - Monthly payments must be based on the highest payment that will apply during the first five years of the loan. The presumptions afforded to lenders making QM loans gives lender protection as follows: - Safe Harbor QM loans - Conclusive Presumption. These are prime loans that (a) Meet the ATR compliance rules including the underwriting requirements above; (b) Are secured by a first lien on the residence; and (c) Carry an interest rate that is less than 1.5% higher than the average prime rate available.[7] The presumption of ATR compliance is conclusive. It is a complete safe harbor. - Higher-Priced QM Loans - Rebuttable Presumption. Here, the presumption of ATR compliance is rebuttable. These loans include first-position liens with an interest rate of equal to or greater than 1.5% over the available prime rate. Essentially, these loans are ""higher priced"" because the borrowers' credit is less than prime, i.e. the loan is, in the vernacular, ""sub-prime."" Noncompliance with the ATR Rules. Violations of the ATR rules are harsh, and likely to stifle any types of loans that hint of non-compliance. If a material violation is established, the borrower would have the ability to recover back all of the finance charges and fees paid, plus actual damages, statutory damages, attorney fees and court costs. The plaintiff's bar and the class action bar must be sharpening their knives. There is a three year statute of limitations from the date the violation occurred. Conclusion. I marvel at the complexity of these laws which have been implemented to ""protect"" consumers by confusing creditors - especially small creditors, such as park owners selling formerly abandoned homes to fill a space and provide affordable housing. If these small transactions caused the credit and housing crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession, perhaps I could understand. But they didn'. What we're are seeing is a huge net of bureaucratic regulation that has been cast over even the smallest of transactions under the guise of consumer protection. Going forward into 2014, my suggestion is for park owners to decide if: (a) They want to handle these transactions without the use of a MLO (which will add several hundred dollars to each sale) or (b) Go it alone, with knowledge that they will still be expected to comply with the ATR and QM rules. If the latter, my suggestion is to create the simplest of paper transactions, with a market rate interest, no adjustable rates, and a balloon that is not less than five years.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1386868775,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,203,"<p><strong>Question*: I</strong>f a community owner sells one or more homes (e.g. those received via abandonment or pre-abandonment) with the help of a Mortgage Loan Originator (""MLO"") working for a third party mortgage banker or mortgage broker, after the buyer's installment contract is completed and signed, can the community owner then collect the payments himself? In other words, now that MLO has complied with the SAFE Act, can this receivable be returned to the community owner to collect the monthly payments? My concern is that someone might say that since the owner is now receiving the payments, he is engaged in the business of ""loan servicing"" - even though it's his own home; he's not in the lending or servicing business; and not receiving or expecting compensation for the act of servicing). It could pose a real financial hardship on community owners if they had to pay a third party for servicing that they can do themselves.

As a park, we would like to purchase new manufactured homes to fill vacant lots. We would purchase them from the manufacturer, set them up, and probably list them through a real estate agent for the marketing. We would not handle the financing, especially under the complicated Dodd-Frank stuff, which would require the prospective purchaser to seek their own means of coming up with the funds to make the purchase. We would not ""carry the paper."" We assume that the real estate people are either MLO's themselves, or can point a prospective purchaser into the direction of a MLO. At this point, we believe that we have the financial portion on our side figured out, but run into a couple of legal questions that you may be able to help us with.</p><p>Today, I contacted the Oregon Division of Finance &amp; Corporate Securities asking what type of Manufactured Structures Dealer (""MSD"") license we would need to purchase new homes from a dealer and resell them within our park. He explained that the Limited MSD license would suffice. I told him that I had read that the limited MSD license authorized the selling of no more than 10 pre-owned manufactured structures during a calendar year, and that my understanding is only abandoned structures and dwellings purchased by the licensee and sited at the licensee's park at the time of sale fit under the LMSD license. I asked him if the sale of the structure ""sited in the park"" meant that when the park owner re-sold the unit the home was required to be sited in the park, or when the park owner purchased the home from the manufacturer the home needed to be already within the park. He told me that that was a good question that no one had asked before but still felt that a LMSD license would be okay.</p><p>Upon further checking I see that a MSD (not a Limited MSD) allows a business holding that license to sell new and used manufactured structures. Our questions are as follows:<br />€¢ What type of a Manufactured Structure License would we need to sell new homes that we have purchased from a dealership or manufacturer?<br />€¢ Can we as park even hold a MSD License?<br />€¢ Would our idea of placing the marketing of the home into the hands of a real estate agent release us from having to become or hire an independent MLO?</p>",963,997,1580,15730,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Selling New Manufactured Home for Community Sales,"<p>Answer: The following answers should not be regarded as ""legal advice"" since this column is intended to be purely educational and for general information purposes. You need to consult your own attorney for a legal opinion. - You are correct about the law; the limited dealer's license is just for park owners with abandoned homes. There is no provision for dealers with a limited license to sell new homes. According to the law, you need a regular dealer's license. See, ORS 446.696, 446.701 and 446.706. - I am troubled that the DFCS said they thought it was OK for you to sell new homes under a limited license, since limited licenses are for abandoned homes which are (presumably) pre-owned. Having said that, if you wanted to proceed on the DFCS's advice, I suspect that if some official later objected, they would have a hard time taking any punitive measures you're your noncompliance. Of course, you never know. The IRS gives out information all the time, and following their advice is no defense to a violation. Why don't you ask if they will put their verbal statement in writing? - I agree that the law says a dealer under a regular license (as opposed to a limited license) may sell new and used homes (so long as he/she discloses that they will sell used homes in the application). - Note that you do not need a MLO license to sell homes. You may use a real estate broker to list and sell your new homes. The fact that they are sited at your park and later sold does not make them ""resales."" However, to offer or negotiate the financing terms of a purchase money loan, you would need the services of an Oregon licensed MLO (i.e. a mortgage broker or mortgage banker). The real estate brokers can handle the transaction, write it up, etc., but cannot advertise or negotiate specific financial terms were you to carry the paper. - However, if you are going to require that the buyers secure their own financing (i.e. you are not going to ""carry the paper""), I see no reason that you need to worry about MLOs, since you will be selling for cash. You will not be taking payments over time. It will be the buyer's lender who will be acting as the MLO (i.e. the mortgage broker or mortgage banker), and negotiating the terms of the purchase money loan to the buyer. - My reading of Oregon administrative rule 441-446-0203 prohibits dealers from acquiring an ownership interest in a park only appears to apply if you are going to offer or negotiate the terms of a residential mortgage loan, i.e. engage in MLO activities or are doing so under an exemption under the MLO laws. Since buyer financing is going to occur via third-party lenders, I do not believe you are prohibited as a ""dealer"" from owning an interest in a manufactured housing community. - From my perspective, you would be much safer to have someone with a full dealer's license handle the sales program. The real estate licensee can list the homes, find the buyers, write up the transactions (making them subject to third-party financing, etc.). The dealer can handle the transaction from there.

(1) If a licensed manufactured structure dealer dies or becomes incapacitated, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may issue a temporary manufactured structure dealer license to the executor, administrator or personal representative of the estate of the dealer or to an agent of the dealer approved by the department. A temporary license issued under this subsection expires after six months, but the department may extend the license for good cause. The department may not extend a temporary license if the license has been suspended or the licensee placed on probation by the department. (2) A person issued a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must deliver to the department a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements under ORS 446.726. A bond or letter of credit covering a license term of less than one year must be for the sum otherwise required for each year a license is valid and must be renewed if the term is extended. The temporary manufactured structure dealer is responsible for ensuring that, during the term of the temporary license, the dealership and its employees comply with ORS 446.661 to 446.756. and rules adopted thereunder. This subsection does not relieve a manufactured structure dealer licensed under ORS 446.691 or 446.696 from liability for a violation arising out of actions or omissions by the dealer. (3) Notwithstanding ORS 446.731: (a) Issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license does not, by itself, affect the rights or interests of any creditors of the dealer in dealership assets or inventory. (b) Issuance or expiration of a temporary license is not a transfer of interest for purposes of ORS 446.736. (4) A person obtaining a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must pay the applicable fee specified in ORS 446.721 for issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license. [2003 c.655 _29a] Footnote 3: 446.706 Limited manufactured structure dealer; licensing. (1) A person who holds a limited manufactured structure dealer license issued under this section may sell during a calendar year up to 10 manufactured dwellings located at a manufactured dwelling park identified in the license. The manufactured dwellings sold under a limited manufactured structure dealer license must be dwellings that: (a) Have been abandoned as described in ORS 90.675 at any manufactured dwelling park. If the manufactured dwelling is not subject to sale by the limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 90.675 (10), the dealer must have the certificate of title or registration for the dwelling transferred to the dealer prior to offering the dwelling for sale; or (b) Have been purchased by the park owner from a person holding title, and at the time of purchase by the park owner, were sited in the manufactured dwelling park identified in the license. (2) Notwithstanding ORS 90.525, if a limited manufactured structure dealer sells a manufactured dwelling that was abandoned at a manufactured dwelling park other than the park where the dwelling is being sold, the sale terms for the manufactured dwelling must require that the dwelling is to be sited under a rental agreement at the park where sold for at least 12 months following the sale. (3) Except as provided in ORS 446.741, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall issue a limited manufactured structure dealer license to a person if the person: (a) Owns or operates a manufactured dwelling park as defined in ORS 446.003; (b) Submits a completed application for a limited manufactured structure dealer license in a form approved by the director; (c) Delivers to the director a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements under ORS 446.726, except that the bond or letter of credit must be in the sum of $15,000 for each year that the license is valid; (d) Delivers to the director a corporate surety bond that meets the requirements specified in ORS 86A.227 if the person employs or intends to employ a mortgage loan originator, as defined in ORS 86A.200, or is otherwise subject to ORS 86A.200 to 86A.239; (e) Certifies to the director in a form and manner the director specifies by rule that the person has independently verified that every individual the person hired or intends to hire as a mortgage loan originator meets the requirements set forth in ORS 86A.200 to 86A.239 and in ORS 86A.186; (f) Is 18 years of age or older or is legally emancipated; and (g) Pays the fee specified in ORS 446.721 for issuance of a limited manufactured structure dealer license.

If the person is a corporation, the application must include the names of the principal officers of the corporation and residence addresses of the officers and the name of the state under whose laws the corporation is organized. If the person is the owner of a manufactured dwelling park, the person may submit a joint application on behalf of the person and a named park operator employed by the person. If the person is the operator of a manufactured dwelling park, the application must include the name and signature of the park owner. (5) A limited manufactured structure dealer license is valid for use at a single manufactured dwelling park. The manufactured dwelling park location must be specified in the license application. A limited manufactured structure dealer may not employ a salesperson. (6) A limited manufactured structure dealer license is valid for two years, but the director may adjust the term of an initial license for the purpose of establishing uniform expiration dates. (7) Notwithstanding subsection (6) of this section, the limited manufactured structure dealer license for the person expires immediately if the person ceases to be an operator or owner of the manufactured dwelling park at which the license may be used. The owner of a manufactured dwelling park shall immediately notify the director if a person licensed under this section ceases to be an owner or operator of a manufactured dwelling park at which the license may be used. (8) Notwithstanding subsections (6) and (7) of this section, if a licensed person ceases to be an operator of the manufactured dwelling park, the park owner may apply to have a corrected license issued to a new operator employed by the owner. A corrected license issued under this subsection is valid for the unexpired portion of the original license term. The director shall charge the fee specified in ORS 446.721 for issuing a corrected license. (9) A limited manufactured structure dealer may renew a license as provided by the director. The director shall renew a license only if the dealer: (a) Submits a completed application for renewal in a form approved by the director; (b) Delivers to the department a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements described in subsection (3) of this section; and (c) Pays the fee specified in ORS 446.721 for renewal of a limited manufactured structure dealer license.

I am under the impression that if we require this of all residents that we would have to give a rent reduction equivalent to the value of the carports. Is this true? And if this is a voluntary program (i.e. the residents can buy them if they want and then turn them into enclosed garages), would a rent reduction still be required?</p>",963,997,1580,15735,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Selling Park-owned Carports to Residents,"<p>Answer: There is no specific law regarding this issue. However, you clearly understand the ramifications i.e. if a service or amenity is withdrawn, the inference usually is that the landlord has received some financial benefit. In this case, the ""benefit"" is that the landlord is no longer responsible for maintenance, and the resident is. My position generally is that this type of arrangement should net out to zero in cost/benefit to both sides. That is, here, if the cost of maintenance is shifted from the landlord to the resident, then there must be some offsetting benefit to the resident. If you believe you can allocate the estimated cost that has been shifted to the resident, e.g. $5.00 per month [I am using the figure as an example - I have no idea what the actual figure might be. - PCQ] then there would be a commensurate $5.00/month reduction in rent. The more difficult issue is whether you may ""require"" this. I doubt it. The residents never signed on to ownership of a park amenity when they commenced their lease or rental. In fact, a cynic would say that you're only doing this because of the condition or age of the carports. I'm not, but I'm suspecting this as a response from some if you attempted to ""require"" that all residents assume ownership of them. There is also the issue of the condition of the carports. Are you going to warrant to each resident that they are in good condition? Or, is this going to be an AS-IS sale? If the latter you most certainly cannot require they agree to take over ownership of carports when you decline to stand behind their quality. If the idea is that once bought, a resident could ""upgrade"" them, you need to think the idea all the way through. For example, any such construction must first be approved by Management. Are you going to require that all work must be performed by bonded contractors who have liability insurance and are licensed with the Construction Contractors Board? You will need to post a Notice of Nonresponsibility for construction liens. [I have seen liens imposed on park owned property for a resident's construction project that was (foolishly) approved by Management.] Are you going to permit residents to do the construction work themselves? If so, you must make clear that the work must be performed in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, especially the applicable building codes. Who is going to then monitor construction to make sure what was approved is what was built? Is the manager qualified to do this, and does he/she have time? Are you going to require the residents undertaking construction [either themselves or through a contractor] first sign an agreement to assume all liability and release the park and Management from damages? If a third party does the work, besides licensing, you have to make sure they have workers comp insurance (i.e. SAIF). You cannot assume all contractors have this insurance. The smaller the contractor, e.g. solos, the greater the chance they may have neglected to obtain workers comp. If there were an accident resulting in personal injuries, e.g. falling off the roof of the new garage, without SAIF, the injured worker could look to you. Lastly, what are you going to do upon sale of the home? I assume the resident will be selling title to the garage. Since the garage is affixed to the land, would assume a regular ""deed"" be given, as opposed to a bill of sale [as is common for personal property, such as a manufactured home]. So how is this going to work? Certainly, you don't want residents delivering deeds to the garage, since they actually don't own the underlying land. Yet once affixed to the land, the garage becomes a part of the land. You will certainly have to cover this issue if/when you undertake this program. It's possible that you would just give a revocable ""license"" or ""permit"" to the resident, allowing the use and construction, but not pure ownership. And be careful of a resident claiming that you owe them for the value of the improvement, since upon resale of the home, you might increase the space rent because of the ""enclosed garage."" In light of all the issues, it seems that if you decide to plow ahead with this idea, it seems to me that it should be voluntary, with adequate disclosures and releases per above, so that the resident can never say they had no choice in the matter. There is little question in my mind, that if you made this program mandatory, a court of law would not enforce it, no matter how ironclad.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1390334878,1402810599,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,181,"<p>Question: A community owner entered into a Storage Agreement on a home in early January 2011.

I will supply them and then answer. So, let's assume the following: (a) This is a periodic (i.e. month-to-month) tenancy; (b) The tenant has moved out of the home and it is now vacant; (c) The rents are not being paid; and lastly, let's assume that (d) The landlord was to be paid all past-due rent from the sale proceeds. However, before answering the question, however, let me point out a fatal error by this landlord - and many other landlords: They don't look at the Worst Case Scenario. I'm sure the Storage Agreement adequately covered what was to occur upon sale. But since we have a landlord now asking what happens if the sale does not occur by November 30, I'm led to believe the parties neglected to address (in writing) the possibility of failure. Memo to MHCO landlords: Written agreements with tenants should always address ""the exit strategy"" - i.e. what protocol kicks in if the home is not sold and not removed by November 30. Without addressing this issue in the written Storage Agreement, we are left to figure out what Oregon law would provide under these facts. Here's my take: - On December 1, the landlord should contact the ex-tenant and demand that the home be removed. This should be done in writing or e-mail, so it can be used later if necessary. - If removal does not occur promptly, the landlord must rely upon Oregon law. Unfortunately, the law leaves landlords holding the bag if a home is abandoned. - The landlord will have to determine if the tenant will voluntarily waive his abandonment rights, and if not, then he must follow the legal procedure under ORS 90.675. If there is a lienholder on the home, the landlord will have to give them notification under the abandonment law. - If the landlord wants to leave the home on the site and resell it to a new tenant, that option is always available , and probably should be pursued first, rather than going down the abandonment route, which can be costly in time and money. Care should be exercised to properly document such an arrangement, in order to avoid later complaints by the tenant that they were taken advantage of. In Oregon, following the formal abandonment process is the only legal way for a landlord to take control of a manufactured home if the tenant fails or refuses to remove it upon termination of the tenancy.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1320077553,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13379,"<p> </p><p><strong><em>Question</em></strong>.

The landlord or landlord's agent may not enter if the tenant, after receiving the landlord's notice, denies consent to enter.

The same applies to repair of the lighting. However, here's the conundrum. If you ask for ""permission"" to install the new lighting, it could be denied, and then you have to go to court for permission. So rather than asking for ""permission"", I suggest you confer with the affected tenants and work with them on the access, i.e. presume you have the right to do so, and collaborate with the resident on timing, etc. Their main concern will likely be whether it will flood their house with light at night. You need to be sensitive to that issue.</p><br><p><strong><em>Tips:</em></strong> When giving the 24-hour access <strong>(MHCO Form 51)</strong>, it is sufficient if you give it at least 24 hours in advance <em><u>covering a particular period of time</u></em>. I don't recommend just 24 hours; if you know the installer will be out on October 10, don't give the notice on October 9. Give as much advance notice as possible. Secondly, if the installer will take three days to complete the job, you don't have to give 24-hours' notice each day they return. If you understand it will be a three day job, add a couple more for Murphy's law, and then give a notice saying something to the effect that ""Commencing on XXX date and continuing until YYY day, ABC company will be at your space (No. ___) between the hours of ______ AM and ______ PM <strong><em>[times must be reasonable - PCQ]</em></strong> to install new safety lighting for the community."" And presumably, since you've already addressed tenant concerns, that should suffice, and the advance collaboration will reduce the chance of push-back.

I understand that under certain circumstances, there is an ""offset"" we can take against the total rent reductions we are required to give residents for the common areas. How does all that work?</p>",963,997,1580,15733,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Submetering and Common Areas,"<p>Answer: The submetering statutes, ORS 90.531 - 90.539 are complex and confusing. As most owners and managers know who have explored converting to submeters, the concept is relatively simple. But the devil is in the details, i.e. the statutes. The basic concept is that for communities with utilities [e.g. water and sewer] that are buried in the base rent, they may extract those charges from base rent, and pass them through to the residents directly for payment. The ""quid pro quo"" for this is that the residents' base rent is reduced in a commensurate amount, so in theory, there is no initial net difference to landlord or tenant. But when utilities are increased, it becomes the residents' immediate responsibility to pay the increased charge - the landlord no longer has to raise the rent via a 90-day notice to recover the increase. Your question specifically pertains to one of the ""devilish details' of this conversion process, i.e. passing through the utility cost for common areas. Specifically, you are referring to subsection (5) of ORS 90.537 (""Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges""). That statute provides that a landlord who has previously included utilities and services in their base rent [called ""the rent billing method""] and converts to the ""submeter billing method"" may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submetering, begin billing for common areas to a ""pro rata billing method"" [i.e. where the residents' cost of the utility is charged and paid separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider's charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter]. This common area charge must be included in the 180-day notice to residents that precedes the submeter conversion process. This means that the landlord would charge each resident a prorata portion of the master meter readings attributable to common area costs. Obviously, master meter readings do not distinguish between utility services provided to residents, versus those provided to common areas. For purposes of determining the amount of the offset the landlord should check with the utility provider to find out the cost of its service to the common areas. If the provider cannot provide the landlord with an accurate cost for service to the common areas, the landlord ""shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed."" Note: Only if the landlord continues use the rent billing method for the cost of utilities to the common areas may the landlord may obtain an offset against the total rent reduction given to residents. This is because if the common area utility cost is still buried inside the base rent. It would be unfair to the landlord to require a dollar-for-dollar rent reduction for all utilities, since those attributed to the common areas are not passed directly through to the tenants for separate payment. In other words, the right of offset  '_is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method."" If the cost of the utility service to the common area is apportioned on a prorate basis and passed through to the residents, there will be no need for offset against the rent reduction as a part of the conversion to submeters. In those cases, the landlord may only apportion the common area utility cost on a prorata basis. For purposes of determining the pro rata charge per resident, ORS 90.534 (""Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area"") clarifies the protocol to be followed: - A utility charge that is assessed to residents on a pro rata basis must be allocated among them  '_by a method that reasonably apportions the cost among the affected tenants and that is described in the rental agreement."" - Methods that reasonably apportion the cost among the residents include, but are not limited to, methods that divide the cost based on: _ The number of occupied spaces in the facility; _ The number of residents or occupants in the home compared with the number of residents or occupants in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service; or _ The square footage in each home compared with the total square footage of occupied homes in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service. - A utility or service charge to be assessed to a resident for a common area must be described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge for the tenant's space. - A landlord may not: _ Bill or collect more money from residents for utilities or services than the provider charges the landlord; _ Increase the utility or service charge to a resident by adding any costs of the landlord, such as handling or administrative charges.

Specifically: - The temporary occupancy agreement is between the landlord, tenant and temporary occupant - all must sign. - The temporary occupant does not have the same rights as a tenant under the landlord-tenant law. - One may terminate the temporary occupancy agreement as follows: _ Only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement ; presumably the theft constitutes a material violation under your rules and regulations which the temporary occupant is required to comply with; it is certainly a violation of law, which would suffice. _ The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation; _ Legally, you do not have to give written notice of termination to the temporary occupant. However, in this case, I would do so, just for the record, and to make it clear that a notice of termination was, in fact, given. _ The temporary occupant is required to ""promptly vacate"" upon receipt of the notice. I suggest you give him/her a couple of days, just to avoid an issue. _ Although the statute doesn'texpressly require it, I would copy the resident on the notice. - If, after you give the notice, the temporary occupant sneaks back in the evenings, as seems to occur frequently, you should give the temporary occupant a formal ""No Trespassing"" letter, with a copy to the resident. It would be preferable if you had these notices personally delivered if you can. Then if the temporary occupant comes back, you may call the police to have him/her removed. - Alternatively, except as provided in ORS 90.449 (the statute protecting victims of domestic violence), a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the resident under ORS 90.630 (the statute permitting for-cause terminations) if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate the dwelling, or if the resident materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement. - A temporary occupant shall be treated as a squatter if he/she continues to occupy the dwelling unit after you have terminated the temporary occupancy agreement. _ ORS 90.100 (41) defines a squatter as ""a person occupying a dwelling unit who is not so entitled under a rental agreement or who is not authorized by the tenant to occupy that dwelling unit."" _ The landlord-tenant statutes do not have a specific provision dealing with eviction of ""squatters."" Although it implies you could have them forcefully removed, I would not attempt any self-help remedies. Rather, you could simply file an eviction, attach a copy of the termination notice, and proceed from there. Alternatively, you could proceed against the temporary occupant and the mother, if she did nothing to make sure he was out. If all else fails, I prefer the former approach, since frequently, a parent - especially an aged parent - is simply not capable of insisting that the son/daughter leave, and I don't believe that failure alone, should result in them losing their right to remain in the community. - Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, the law permits landlords to screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record. If that was not done in this instance it should have been. (Note that a landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level.)

The temporary occupant agreement concept is that the person is not going to be a ""co-renter"". They are being permitted to come onto the space as an accommodation by the landlord to the current resident who wants them there. If they are to become a temporary occupant, but your background check inadvertently reveals derogatory references related to financial information, and that concerns you, then limit the amount of time they can remain there, and take things a month, or six months, at a time. You might consider having tenants fill out a form in advance explaining exactly why they want the temporary occupant there. If a tenant wants them there to share the rental obligation then you should know that before offering the temporary occupant status. If that is the case, then have them apply as a tenant. If they don't pass the financial background check, then reject them on that basis.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupancy agreement states that the temporary occupant must comply with the laws/Rules Regulations &amp; Policies of the community. Who is responsible to provide this information to the temporary occupant and when should it be given?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> I understand that the temporary occupant law does not specifically address this point. But you have the most to lose if the rules are not given to them at the outset of the temporary occupant relationship. That being the case, I would suggest you append the rules to the temporary occupant agreement, and have them sign both the agreement and the attached rules. Then there is no question about whether they got them.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupant agreement and the law state that a temporary occupant can be terminated ""for cause"" if there is a material violation of the occupancy agreement and that the temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation. The other option is termination by automatic expiration of the agreement (if the box is checked that specifies this). If the landlord needs to issue a for cause termination (instead of termination by automatic expiration) the termination must be done in accordance with the law outlined in ORS 90.392 (for non-MHP tenancies) or 90.630 (for MHP tenancies). However after reading these statutes, they do not give an option for the landlord to issue a for cause notice with no right to cure. How is a landlord supposed to issue a for cause termination notice with no right to cure and have it held up in court? If a landlord issues a for cause notice with no right to cure, what form should be used and what is the time frame for the termination?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The temporary occupant law is addressed in ORS 90.275. You may terminate the temporary occupant for a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement. That agreement also terminates by its own terms when it expires (if you checked that box on the form). The law says that upon termination or expiration, the temporary occupant shall ""promptly vacate."" If they don', then the landlord can issue a for cause termination under 90.630 (for MHP tenancies) to the tenant - not the temporary occupant. That means you would issue a termination notice under 90.630 for the tenant to vacate if the temporary occupant failed to do so as required. The opportunity to cure is for the tenant to get the temporary occupant to vacate. If they temporary occupant fails to vacate within the 30-day cure period given by law to the tenant, then the entire space tenancy is terminated. In such case, the law says the temporary occupant - if they remain - is treated as a ""squatter."" ORS 90.403 then permits you to give a 24-hour non-curable termination notice to the ""squatter"" and evict, if necessary, through the normal FED process.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1332868771,1402810696,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13154,"<p> </p><p><strong>Question.  </strong>As a manager, do I have the ability to terminate the tenancy of a current resident who committed a crime outside of the community?</p>",963,997,1580,16254,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Tenant Crimes Committed Outside Park,"<br><p><strong>Answer</strong>.

Background. Landlords in Oregon are understandably flummoxed by the new prescription drug du jour, medical marijuana. Why?</p>",963,997,1580,15712,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Tenant Medical Marijuana Use in Oregon: Is it One Toke Over the Landlord's Line?,"<p>Because, while Oregon permits the medical use of marijuana, the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. _ 801, et seq., says that it is illegal to manufacture, distribute, and possess marijuana, even when state law authorizes its use. Furthermore, federal law supersedes state law where there is a direct conflict between them. So, what does a landlord do when confronted by a card-carrying tenant claiming that he/she cannot be evicted for marijuana use and/or cultivation, because they have a legal right to do so under Oregon law. To second arrow in the tenant's quiver is the threat that ""if you try to evict me, I will sue you under the federal Fair Housing laws that say you must grant me a reasonable accommodation [i.e. let me toke on the premises] because I have a ""disability."" Discussion. Clearly, this is a very complicated issue on several levels. Marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law, but under Oregon law, its use and cultivation in limited amounts are lawful with a medical marijuana card. The Oregon laws cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder's immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana. For those interested, the specific statutes should be consulted here. Based upon recent news reports, it appears that, subject to certain exceptions, there will be no effort by the federal Department of Justice to seek out and charge violators of the Controlled Substances Act in those states where the medical or recreational use of marijuana are legal. The Conundrum. In short, it appears that when it comes to enforcement of their rules and regulations, Oregon landlords are on their own; neither the feds, nor the state, will go after persons with lawfully issued medical marijuana cards. Furthermore, if a tenant has a valid card, then arguably he or she has some medical condition that has authorized its issuance. Is the landlord obligated under the Fair Housing laws to make a ""reasonable accommodation"" for their medical condition, and permit the tenant to continue their use or grow operation? If properly done, the answer may be ""No."" Here's why: In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was ""Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing."" While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful - though perhaps not a ""final"" resource - on the issue. It is very complete and helpful for all landlords. It can be found at this link. Here is what the Memo directs: Public housing agencies  '_in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users. The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department."" Thus, HUD appears to be leaving it up to the state public housing authorities to decide whether the refusal to permit on-premises use of medical marijuana constitutes a fair housing violation. Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not directly investigate such claims, leaving it up to public housing agencies on the state level. While HUD's pronouncement is directed toward ""public housing"" is would be hard to believe private housing would be treated any differently. Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law. So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes state law. However, in the 2010 case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Oregon Supreme Court held that employers do not have a legal duty to allow employees to use medical marijuana on the job. This case addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in Oregon, both from an employment and housing perspective. Additionally, a subsequent article [found here] by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon is helpful for landlords from the view of private fair housing enforcement. Thus, it appears that in Oregon, on both the federal and state levels, enforcement agencies are [for the time being at least] taking a laissez-faire approach to the medical marijuana issue. This means that landlords have it within their control, with little fear of a fair housing/reasonable accommodation claim, to enact rules and regulations prohibiting the on-premises use of medical marijuana. However, the proscription should not be retroactive to tenants holding legal medical marijuana cards who have already signed their rental agreements or leases. Oregon Landlord-Tenant Laws. Oregon statutes permit landlords to enforce tenant violations of their rental agreements, rules, and general laws [not just the landlord-tenant laws]. It is my belief that the violation of a no medical marijuana policy would be enforceable on a going forward basis. The policy should not be retroactive - and it should so state. In summary, ORS 90.630 [Termination by Landlord] provides as follow: - After delivery of written notice, a landlord may terminate the rental agreement for cause and take possession in accordance with the state eviction laws [ORS 105.105 to 105.168], unless the tenant cures the violation. - Causes for termination are: _ Material violations of the rental agreement; _ Material violation by the tenant of his/her legal duties under [ORS 90.740]; _ Failure to pay rent. - The landlord's notice to the tenant must: _ Specify the acts and omissions constituting the violation; _ State that the rental agreement will terminate upon a designated date not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice; and _ If the violation may be cured under the law, so state and describe at least one possible remedy to cure it, designating the date by which the cure must occur. - If the violation described in the notice can be cured, and is cured by the designated date, the tenancy will not terminate; - If the tenant does not cure the violation, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice. - If the cause of a written notice relates to substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior violation for which notice was given within the previous six months, the designated termination date must be not less than 20 days after delivery of the notice and no earlier than the designated termination date stated in the previously given notice. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation. Miscellaneous Tips. Landlords, read the medical marijuana card! It must valid and current for Oregon. A California card, for example, would not suffice. [See, State v. Berrenger, 2010]. If there is no card, or no current card, the growing [not use] of marijuana may still be a violation of Oregon law. In such cases, issuance of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630 may be appropriate. If other tenants are complaining about the odor [and many do], a landlord may consider looking to the ""quiet enjoyment"" provisions of the rental agreement, the rules, or the provisions in ORS 90.740(4)(i). Conclusion. Rental management companies and individual landlords in Oregon may wish to institute a written medical marijuana policy in their rules and/or rental agreements, dealing both with use and cultivation. Based upon current federal law, it does not appear to be a fair housing violation to prohibit medical marijuana in the landlord's rental agreement or rules. If such a policy exists, it should include management's right to decline a request for a reasonable accommodation. Remember, besides nonpayment of rent, there are only three ways to terminate a tenancy for cause: - Violation of the rental/lease agreement; - Violation of the rules; and - Violation of Oregon laws. This means that in Oregon, if a tenant engages in the legal use or cultivation of marijuana - i.e. with a valid card - doing so is not a violation of state law. If a landlord seeks to prevent such activity, the answer must then be found, if at all, in the rental agreement or the rules. Without an express prohibition contained in one of these documents, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for legal marijuana use or cultivation - unless the tenant's conduct violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1402410629,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,412,"<p>Question: An occupant lives in a home that is sub-leased from his parents who have moved to Arizona.

One, you've accepted rent from the occupant for the last several months. For all intents and purposes, you have accepted him as a tenant - even though he is not there on a written rental agreement and even though you have no criminal background check on him. Even if your rules prohibit subleasing, that too, has been waived. In other words, all of the breaches you could have enforced against him and/or the tenants who subleased, have been waived and are now unenforceable. Here are the rules on waiver that apply in this situation [ORS 90.412]. While they are of no help in this situation, they may be helpful in the future. A landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord: - During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant; or - Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement. - A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if: _ Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent; or _ The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. - A landlord does not waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for a violation under any of the following circumstances: _ The landlord and tenant agree otherwise after the violation has occurred. _ The violation concerns the tenant's conduct and, following the violation but prior to acceptance of rent for three rental periods or performance, the landlord gives a written warning notice to the tenant regarding the violation that: - Describes specifically the conduct that constitutes the violation, either as a separate and distinct violation, a series or group of violations or a continuous or ongoing violation; - States that the tenant is required to discontinue the conduct or correct the violation; and - States that a reoccurrence of the conduct that constitutes a violation may result in a termination of the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.392, 90.398, 90.405 or 90.630. _ The tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home, and the violation concerns: - Disrepair or deterioration of the manufactured dwelling or floating home; - A failure to maintain the rented space; - The termination is under ORS 90.396 [24-hour notices]. _ The landlord accepts: - A last month's rent deposit collected at the beginning of the tenancy, regardless of whether the deposit covers a period beyond a termination date; - Rent distributed pursuant to a court order releasing money paid into court; or - Rent paid for a rent obligation not yet due and paid more than one rental period in advance. - For a continuous or ongoing violation, the landlord's written warning notice remains effective for 12 months and may be renewed with a new warning notice before the end of the 12 months. - A landlord that must refund rent shall make the refund to the tenant or other payer by personal delivery or first class mail. The refund may be in the form of the tenant's or other payer's check or in any other form of check or money. The most important thing you should do at this point is to try to determine if this occupant is a sexual predator. Oregon laws were revised a few years ago to provide that if an occupant is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587, you may unilaterally issue him a 30-day notice to vacate.

Nowhere in the Act is there a clear answer. But connecting some dots, I think we can arrive at a logical answer. - Technically, the 18-year old is not a tenant under the manufactured housing park (""MHP"") side of the Act, since he does not ""own"" the home. At best, he is a ""tenant"" under the non-MHP side of the law - he could be considered a month-to-month tenant, and therefore subject to the 30-day right of termination by the landlord. Assuming this, what is the landlord to do? First, do the rules permit subleasing? If not, he could be compelled to leave. - Second, rent should not be accepted from him until this situation is clarified and a solution reached. - Third, if the landlord is willing to accept the 18-year old under these circumstances (i.e. assuming he goes into title), he could be offered a monthly tenancy, subject to his qualifying under the community rules, etc. which, of course, require the background check, etc. - Lastly, again assuming the landlord is willing to accept him, a guarantee by the parents might be in order. - Keep in mind that since he was not a signatory to the original rental agreement since he was a minor, the fact that he is the only person remaining at the home, technically makes him an authorized occupant that has not yet been approved by park management. This is your strongest card, and you should use it to fashion the solution that best fits your needs. All of these things require some legal guidance, but the answer to the above question is that the landlord, by acting carefully, should be able to protect his position and either require the 18-year old to vacate or qualify in all respects as a new resident (assuming he goes into ownership of the home).

Here is a brief primer:</p><br><p><strong><u>Three Strikes</u></strong>:   Pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630(8)</a>, a landlord may terminate a space rental agreement for a manufactured dwelling or floating home if:</p><ul>	<li>The tenant has not paid the monthly rent prior to the eighth day of the month assuming rent is due on the first day of each month, and,</li>	<li>A 72-hour notice is issued<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> in <em><u>at least three of the preceding 12 months</u></em>; and</li>	<li>The landlord warns the tenant of the risk of a 30-day notice for termination with no right to correct the cause, upon the occurrence of a third nonpayment of rent termination notice within a 12-month period. This warning must be contained in at least two 72-hour notices that precede the third notice within the 12-month period (or in separate written notices that are given concurrently with, or a reasonable time after, each of the two preceding 72-hour notices); and</li>	<li>The 30-day notice of termination must state facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the cause for termination of the tenancy which is given to the tenant concurrent with, or after the third or a subsequent nonpayment of rent termination notice.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></li></ul><p><strong><u>Take-Aways.  </u></strong></p><br><ul>	<li>The MHCO 72-hour Notice (Form No. 42) already contains the warning about a non-curable 30-day notice for three strikes, i.e.  issuance of three 72-hour notices within the preceding twelve months. No separate warning needs to be given. All management needs to do is complete the form and identify whether it is the first, second, or third such notice.</li>	<li>Note: The purpose of the 3-strikes statute is to discourage serial late-paying.  The violation is not ""cured"" by paying the rent late after issuance of a 72-hour notice - in other words, it still counts toward issuance of a three strikes notice.</li>	<li>The 30-day Notice for a 3-Strikes Violation (Form No. 43A) should be given <em><u>together</u></em> with the third 72-hour notice; if it is mailed it can be in the same envelope or another one simultaneously sent. Always get a Certificate of Mailing when mailing the letter. Do not wait in sending out the 30-day notice! </li>	<li>The 30-day 3-strikes notices is not ""cured"" by payment of the late rent.</li>	<li>Since there <em><u>could</u></em> potentially be a waiver argument if the landlord attempted to terminate for issuance of more than three 72-hour notices, it is recommended that if the tenant was issued more than three such notices within twelve months, the landlord select just three.</li>	<li>Caveat:  Each 72-hour notice must have been properly prepared.  If one of them has been defectively prepared (e.g. wrong date, time, etc.) or incorrectly served (e.g. improper posting and mailing, etc.) it will not count towards the three strikes. For this reason, it is suggested that legal counsel closely review each 72-hour notice that is intended to become the basis of a 3-strikes eviction.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Thirty-Day Notices</u></strong>:   Pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630(1) - (7)</a>, a landlord may terminate a space rental agreement for a manufactured dwelling or floating home if a tenant:</p><ul>	<li>Violates a law or ordinance related to the tenant's conduct as a tenant, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.740"">ORS 90.740 (Tenant Obligations)</a>;</li>	<li>Violates a rule or rental agreement provision related to the tenant's conduct as a tenant and imposed as a condition of occupancy, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with a rental agreement regarding a program of recovery in drug and alcohol free housing;</li>	<li>Is classified as a level three sex offender under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163A.100"">ORS 163A.100 (3)</a>; Note that this violation is not curable, and the 30-day notice must so state; or</li>	<li>Fails to pay a (i) Late charge pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.260"">ORS 90.260</a>; (ii) Fee pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.302"">ORS 90.302</a>; or (iii) Utility or service charge pursuant to <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.534"">ORS 90.534</a> or <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.536"">90.536</a>.</li>	<li>Note that for violation regarding the <em><u>physical condition of the home</u></em>, a 30-day notice does <em><u>not </u></em>arise under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a>; rather <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.632"">ORS 90.632</a> applies.

Caution: If the last day of a 30-day notice of termination is on, say the 15<sup>th</sup> of the month, the landlord's 72-hour notice issued on the 8<sup>th</sup> day of that month should only demand rent up through the 15<sup>th</sup>.  If the 72-hour notice demands rent covering the period after the 15<sup>th</sup>, it could invalidate the 30-day notice since it demands that the tenant pay rent for a period of time beyond the official end of the tenancy. There is also a risk of incorrectly calculating the number of days in the 72-hoour notice. For these reasons, I do not recommend issuance of a 72-hour notice while a 30-day notice is pending.  And if the tenant voluntarily pays the rent while the notice is pending, I recommend immediately returning it, saying that the resident must first timely cure the default identified in the 30-day notice (assuming the default is curable).</li></ul><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Or the fifth day of the rental period is a 144-day notice is used.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> I do not recommend waiting to issue the 30-day notice.

What is the best way to handle this issue?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16557,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Towing Vehicles in the Community,"<p><strong><em>Answer.  </em></strong>This can be a complicated issue. First, there are a series of state statutes governing the towing of vehicles from private property (<a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/98.805"">here</a>). They should be carefully reviewed before undertaking this process. </p><br><p>Here is a relevant portion of the law:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      <strong>98.810 Unauthorized parking of vehicle on proscribed property prohibited.</strong> A person may not, without the permission of:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (1) The owner of a parking facility, leave or park any vehicle on the parking facility <em><u>if there is a sign displayed in plain view at the parking facility prohibiting or restricting public parking on the parking facility</u></em>.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">      (2) The owner of proscribed property, leave or park any vehicle on the proscribed property whether or not there is a sign prohibiting or restricting parking on the proscribed property.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">          </p><p>Also, some cities and counties may have their own ordinances. The City of Portland, for example, has very specific rules (<a href=""https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/39851"">here</a>). Gresham and Tualatin do as well. Plus, the Oregon Department of Justice has various consumer protection rules against ""predatory towing"".  (<a href=""https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/motor-vehicles/towing/"">here</a>).</p><br><p>For manufactured housing communities, I suggest going much farther than relying on state or local laws. If your community decides to do this, it should be clearly disclosed in the rules and regulations. Of utmost importance is proper visible signage, which can either be created by management, or provided by the towing company you decide to use. Make sure the company has a good reputation in all respects, and no records of consumer complaints.</p><br><p>If the violator is a resident, I suggest one or more warnings (following a protocol in your rules) before having the vehicle towed. Once towed, the car is impounded, and the cost of getting it released is <em><u>not</u></em> insubstantial, and the towing company has  storage lien rights.  If the process is not strictly followed, the owner could have a claim against management for conversion, i.e. the civil side of theft.</p><br><p>Fining is a much safer alternative, but must also follow community rules. The worst that can happen if the fine is levied in error is to rescind it. Making an error in the lead-up or during a tow, can be much more costly to management.</p><br><p>Fines can be enforced with a 30-day notice under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630</a>, so long as it is found in the rules. I suggest a warning notice first. Take a picture of it on the car, with the plate visible. Include the date and time. Mail a copy of the notice <em><u>and</u></em> the picture to the resident within 7 - 10 days. Use a certificate of mailing.</p><br><p>Make sure there is proper visible signage describing the proscribed area, the times, if applicable, and the amount of the fine. </p><br><p>If the fine increases on multiple violations, describe that, or reference the park rule.  Do not make the fine punitive. If other communities have such violations, find out what their fines are. Always use the rule of reason; don't impose a fine that most residents could not afford.</p><br><p>The issue of visitors is somewhat different, but rules may be enforced against the resident whose guest they are. That is why a warning notice should first be given. The notice and picture would go to the resident, who will, hopefully, warn their visitor about obeying marked No Parking signs.</p><br>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1528211160,1528211180,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13229,"<br><p><strong>Question: </strong>A park we manage has a tree on one of the lots whose roots are damaging the home owner's driveway, and the neighbor's driveway.

Cutting the roots may make the tree more dangerous, but under the statutory definition, to be a ""hazard tree"" it must measure at least eight inches in <em>diameter at </em><em>breas</em><em>t height</em> (""DBH"")<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>. If it does, then you have the primary responsibility. If it does not then your rules would appear to apply. </p><p>However, even though the tree is not of sufficient size to be a hazard tree under the statute, I think the discussion merits a closer look. Assuming it was in existence at the time the resident rented the space, what the rule seems to say is that even though the landlord owns the ground and the tree, it becomes the tenant's responsibility once leased. As to small trees and normal vegetation, I can understand this rule. But the larger the tree, the more the argument becomes one of ""cost shifting"" i.e. requiring a resident to undertake possibly expensive measures (e.g. removing the tree) for the benefit of the landlord's property.  This issue, in fact, was the rationale behind the hazard tree legislation.</p><p>Oregon law provides that park landlord have certain habitability obligations to residents. <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.730"">ORS 90.730(3)(g)</a> provides:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Excluding the normal settling of land, a surface or ground capable of supporting a manufactured dwelling approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained to support a dwelling in a safe manner so that it is suitable for occupancy. <em><u>A landlord's duty to maintain the surface or ground arises when the landlord knows or should know of a condition regarding the surface or ground that makes the dwelling unsafe to occupy</u>; </em>(Italics mine.)</p><br><p>Although the statute does not refer to driveways and other amenities on the space, it does refer to the ""dwelling"", which includes the skirting. Does the tree root make it ""unsafe"". Probably not, if safety refers just to personal safety and not safety of the property. </p><br><p>However, <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.135"">ORS 90.135</a> (Unconscionability) provides that a resident may argue that shifting the responsibility for maintenance of landlord-owned property - in this case - a non-hazard tree not planted by the resident that is causing damage to residents' property, is ""unconscionable"".  The statute provides:</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">If the court, as a matter of law, finds:  (a) A rental agreement or any provision thereof was unconscionable when made, the court may refuse to enforce the agreement, enforce the remainder of the agreement without the unconscionable provision, or limit the application of any unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result; ***</p><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion.  </em></strong>I am not saying management is, <em>per se'</em> responsible.  But what I am saying is that this is a risk that is better shouldered by a landlord, than a tenant, especially here, where the tree existed before the tenancy, and it ultimately belongs to the landlord. </p><br><p>Note, this may be an insurance issue.  Can the residents file a claim with their carriers for the tree damage?  This depends on their coverage. In the final analysis, the tree should be removed, since it will continue to damage the tenants' property. At some point they could file a claim against you for the cost of that damage.

What are my rights here?</p>",963,997,1580,15731,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Tree Limb Falls On A Residents House,"<p>Answer. Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees. While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees. With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner. Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business. Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem. In reality, however, it is. Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner. Accordingly, the statute allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner: Normal maintenance for trees on a resident's space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a ""hazard tree"" then responsibility shifts to the landlord - unless the resident planted the tree. This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities. Here is a summary of the current law: 1. Definitions. - ""DBH"" means the diameter at breast height, which is measured as the width of a standing tree at four and one-half feet above the ground on the uphill side. - ""Hazard tree"" means a tree that: _ Is located on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park; _ Measures at least eight inches DBH; and _ Is considered, by an arborist licensed as a landscape construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk of causing serious physical harm or damage to individuals or property in the near future. 2. Habitability. A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 3. Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space. A resident shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches and leaves, on the rented space for a manufactured dwelling except for hazard trees. - ""Maintaining a tree"" means removing or trimming a tree for the purpose of eliminating features of the tree that cause the tree to be hazardous, or that may cause the tree to become hazardous in the near future. - ""Removing a tree"" includes: _ Felling and removing the tree; and _ Grinding or removing the stump of the tree. 4. Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. - Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that was not planted by the current resident if the landlord knows or should know that the tree is a hazard tree; - Landlord may maintain a tree on the rented space to prevent the tree from becoming a hazard tree; _ Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves. - Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming. - Landlord is not responsible for: _ Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or _ Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes. - A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident's space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. - PCQ] - Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident's space at the resident's expense. _ The resident may retain an arborist licensed as a landscape construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society of Arboriculture to inspect a tree on the resident's space at the resident's expense; _ If the arborist determines that the tree is a hazard, the resident may: - Require the landlord to maintain the tree as a hazard tree; or - Maintain the tree at the resident's expense, after providing the landlord with reasonable written notice of the proposed maintenance and a copy of the arborist's report. 5. Tree Obstructing Removal of Home From Space. If a manufactured home cannot be removed from a space without first removing or trimming a tree on the space, the owner of the home may remove or trim the tree at the owner's expense, after giving reasonable written notice to the landlord, for the purpose of removing the home. 6. Use of Landscape Professional. The landlord or resident that is responsible for maintaining a tree must engage a landscape construction professional with a valid landscape license issued pursuant to ORS 671.560 to maintain any tree with a DBH of eight inches or more. 7. Access to Resident's Space [ORS 90.725]. - An ""emergency"" includes but is not limited to: _ A repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious physical harm or damage to individuals or property; _ The presence of a hazard tree on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park. - An ""unreasonable time"" refers to a time of day, day of the week or particular time that conflicts with the resident's reasonable and specific plans to use the space. - ""Yard maintenance, equipment servicing or grounds keeping"" includes, but is not limited to, servicing individual septic tank systems or water pumps, weeding, mowing grass and pruning trees and shrubs. - A landlord or a landlord's agent may enter onto a rented space to: _ Inspect or maintain trees; _ A landlord or the landlord's agent may enter a rented space solely to inspect a tree despite a denial of consent by the resident if the landlord or the landlord's agent has given at least 24 hours' actual notice of the intent to enter to inspect the tree and the entry occurs at a reasonable time. _ If a landlord has a report from an arborist licensed as a landscape construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society of Arboriculture that a tree on the rented space is a hazard tree that must be maintained by the landlord under this Act, the landlord is not liable for any damage or injury as a result of the hazard tree if the landlord is unable to gain entry after making a good faith effort to do so. - If the resident refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement pursuant to ORS 90.630 (1) and take possession in accordance with the Oregon eviction statutes. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages. 8. Statement of Policy. It shall include the facility policy regarding the planting of trees on the resident's rented space. [See ORS 90.510] Conclusion. It sounds as if your solution was a good one and everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Your question did not specify whether the tree was a ""hazard tree."" If it was, then my question to you would have been: Did you develop a tree policy for your park? By the fact that you're asking this question, I assume you have none. Even if you did, it would be hard to apply it retroactively. With the recent snow storms of February, perhaps community owners will become more mindful of these issues. The first order of business is to take a survey of the hazard trees, and then develop a program for safety maintenance. Lastly, of course, park owners should always have a good policy of liability insurance for $1,000,000 or more that covers this type of situation. Fortunately, no one was injured in your situation, but if so, the solution might not have been so easy.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1393600834,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,312,"<p>Question: While doing an inspection with my manager, she showed me a large tree branch that had fallen onto a resident's home in our park. The issue here is that the tree is located on neighboring land and not in our community. The resident whose home was damaged had an arborist out to view the tree and said that the tree was a hazard. What rights and responsibilities do we have in a situation like this?</p>",963,997,1580,15764,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Tree Outside of MHC Damages House inside MHC,"<p>Answer: First, this is not an issue that is addressed - or can be addressed - in our ""hazard tree"" discussions that the MHCO has been having recently in the landlord-tenant coalition meetings. This tree is not located in the park, so is not strictly a landlord ""habitability"" issue. However, under certain circumstances it could be. Clearly, community management does not have authority to cross over onto another's land and cut down the tree - or even trim it. However, if the branches of the tree extend into the community's airspace, it may legally be trimmed by park management. If it is feasible to do so, and done in a manner that is safe and responsible, it should be done. Park management should consult an arborist before proceeding, in order to avoid trimming that could damage or injure the tree itself. Additionally, the property owner next door should be notified about the fallen limb. This is for two reasons: (a) So the owner can secure his/her own expert advice on what to do to the tree to prevent a reoccurrence, and (b) to notify his/her insurance carrier. Whether the resident has a claim against the park owner is hard to tell without knowing more. If the branch extended into the community and was believed to be a potential problem for some time, but ignored by management, then perhaps there is a claim. But the stronger claim is likely against the owner of the tree itself, especially if it had not been properly cared for as a ""hazard tree."" If a claim is asserted against the park owner, he/she should bring a similar claim against the neighbor whose tree it was. Then let the insurance carriers work it out.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1358822749,1402808925,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,303,"<p>Question. Our community is relatively small and the spaces are oversized. Large trees are located on many of them. Occasionally, a resident asks us to thin or top some of the trees on their space, because of fear that during high winds they could break, damaging homes and injuring people. I have been under the impression that tree maintenance is a tenant responsibility under Oregon law. If so, what is our liability if tree limbs -- or entire trees - break during bad weather?</p>",963,997,1580,15766,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Trees - Liability and Responsibility ,"<p>Answer: Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740. Subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement it is the tenant's responsibility to ""(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space... ."" In my opinion, this provision is a good example of how not to draft a statute. Trees are not ""mowed"" and grass is not ""pruned."" However, it is correct that ""pruning"" of trees [whatever that entails] is a tenant responsibility unless otherwise provided in the rental or lease agreement. As with everything these days, the Internet is replete with discussions and definitions of pruning. One example is found here: http://tinyurl.com/Q-Law-Definitions-pruning. Regardless of your reference source, it is clear that there are many, many, different types of pruning, depending upon the goal sought. You can prune to ""teach"" a tree or shrub how to grow in a particular fashion; you can prune for appearance; you can prune for maintenance, i.e. the health of the tree or shrub. Lastly, you prune for safety - this is called ""hazard pruning."" Putting my ""lawyer's hat"" on and returning to my law school roots, I recall a rule of interpretation called ""ejusdem generis"". Here is one definition: ""(eh-youse-dem generous) v adj. Latin for ""of the same kind,"" used to interpret loosely written statutes. Where a law lists specific classes of persons or things and then refers to them in general, the general statements only apply to the same kind of persons or things specifically listed. Example: if a law refers to automobiles, trucks, tractors, motorcycles and other motor-powered vehicles, ""vehicles"" would not include airplanes, since the list was of land-based transportation."" http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/ejusdem-generis.htm Applying that legal rule to ORS 90.740(4)(h), it could reasonably be argued that the words ""maintain, water and mow or prune"" are intended to refer to normal and routine landscaping activities. In other words, a tenant's landscaping responsibility for his or her own space is limited to normal and routine activities. In other words, imposing a statutory duty and financial responsibility of ""hazard pruning"" on manufactured housing residents was unlikely. ORS 90.730(3) provides that ""(f)or purposes of this section, a rented space is considered inhabitable if it substantially lacks: (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin [underscore mine];"" Thus, there is little question that as of the commencement of the tenancy, it is a landlord duty to make sure the community grounds, including the spaces and common areas, are safe for ""normal and reasonably foreseeable uses... ."" Is a 40-foot fir tree ""safe"" at the commencement of the tenancy? Can it be made safe? If it is made safe, e.g. by hazard trimming, will it stay safe for the entire duration of the tenancy? It seems to me that a community landlord has two choices: 1. Doing nothing, and relying upon a poorly drafted statute for absolute immunity when a giant tree falls, killing an entire family during a windstorm; or 2. Envision the Doomsday Scenario - i.e. assume that such a disaster could occur regardless what a poorly drafted statute says, and that a multi-million wrongful death lawsuit will surely be filed by some aggressive plaintiff's attorney, arguing to a jury that the landlord owns the ground, owns the trees coming out of the ground, and is simply trying to avoid the financial responsibility to thin and top dangerous trees. So my advice would be the following: (a) If you are in doubt about your legal responsibilities because the law is unclear, and (b) where doing nothing could place lives in danger, it is far better to undertake the financial responsibility of hazard pruning on a regular basis. In short, relying upon ORS 90.740(4)(h) when it comes to trimming and topping potentially dangerous trees, could be a serious and costly mistake.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1353346424,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13464,"<br><p><strong>Question 1: </strong> If a community is a legal 55+ park, is it still subject to the federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against children?  </p><p><strong>Question 2:  </strong>If the current rules in a family community <em>appear</em> to be discriminatory towards children -- e.g. they place restrictions that have a discriminatory impact on children or persons with children (e.g. curfew on children, even if it's intended to be for their own safety) can the landlord unilaterally amend the rules, or does he/she need to go through the formal rule change process outlined in the <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.610"">ORS 90.610</a>?</p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16564,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Two Questions on Children in Parks,"<p><strong>Answer 1:  </strong>Generally, no. However, this isn'ta license to be rude to them.  Let's start with the basics:  If you are a legal 55+ community, you are not required to admit as residents, persons with children, i.e. those under the age of 18.  If there are children in the community (perhaps before the facility converted to 55+, or simply because less than 20% of all spaces are occupied by persons <em>with</em> children), the park may do things that it could not do if it was a family park, such as prohibit children's Big Wheels and bicycles in the street.  Generally, however, the best approach is to strive for 100% compliance with the 55+ laws in terms of occupancy.  If you want to be a ""safe"" 55+ community, you will have rules that expressly say so; a rental/lease agreement that expressly says so; application and tenant home sale provisions that limit spaces to at least one occupant 55+; and generally hold yourself out in all advertising as a 55+ community.  Of course, seniors are permitted to bring children (e.g. grandchildren, etc.) into the community, but the rules may place limits on the amount of time they may remain there. </p><p><strong>Answer 2:  </strong>You need to go through the formal rule change process described in the statute.  A rule that is not legally enacted, isn'treally an enforceable rule.  However, you should immediately issue a written notice to all residents that based upon legal advice, those rules (identifying them) that appear to be discriminatory against children, will not be enforced.  If you own a family park and are concerned that your rules may appear to ""target"" children, you should consult with your attorney for advice on how to proceed.  Note that even if your rules don't appear to target children, if they, in fact, affect the activities of children more heavily than adults, they could still be deemed to be discriminatory (e.g. occupancy limits).  And if you are a family park, but you have over 80% of the spaces occupied by at least one person age 55 or over, you should ask your attorney about ""converting"" to become a legal 55+ community.  Until you do, even though 99% of the community's spaces are occupied by seniors, you're still a family park, and subject to the anti-discrimination laws protecting children. </p><div> </div><br>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1532618853,1533941459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13074,"<p><strong>Question:  </strong>A pedophile is released from prison and moves in with his mother in a manufactured home community.

For purposes of my response, I will assume that one or both of these documents require that if a resident wants to have a person live with them at the home, they must so notify the landlord, get a background check and have management approval. If they are going to go onto the lease, then their credit record becomes important, and they would have to provide financial information as well.

If the rental agreement allows delivery of notice of a utility or service charge by electronic means, for purposes of this subsection, written notice includes a communication that is transmitted in a manner that is electronic, as defined in ORS 84.004.</p><br><p>My problem is that rent is due seven days from the first of the month, yet the due date for utility charges cannot be less than 14 days.

Per John VanLandingham<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>, who participated in making the change, when the 14 day deadline for payment was deleted, it was recognized that the way for landlords to enforce nonpayment of a utility charge was through the 30-day, curable notice, under <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">90.630 (Termination by landlord)</a>.  MHCO member, Phil Taylor, led the push for this legislation. (See, HB 3482, chapter laws 443 2013). This is now clarified in the current ORS 90.532(7):</p><br><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><em><u>A utility or service charge is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent</u></em> under ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.394"">90.394 (Termination of rental agreement for failure to pay rent)</a>, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">90.630 (Termination by landlord)</a>. A <em><u>landlord may not give a notice of termination of a rental agreement under ORS </u></em><a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630""><em>90.630 (Termination by landlord)</em></a><em><u> for nonpayment of a utility or service charge sooner than the eighth day, including the first day the utility or service charge is due</u></em>, after the landlord gives the tenant the written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge. (Emphasis added.)</p><br><p>Prior to these changes, the statutes were confusing as to when a utility charge was due, and when it was late, for purposes of issuing a termination notice. Now, the utility charge is due upon delivery of the bill.  If it is not paid by the 8th day after delivery, it is considered late, and a landlord can give a curable 30-day cause termination notice. The cause of the notice is non- payment of the utility charge, and the cure is payment.   </p><p>                     <br /><strong><em>C</em></strong><em>onclusion.</em> The take-away here for readers is to always make sure you're reviewing the latest statute.

The landlord served the resident (who was driving the motorcycle) with a 30 notice for violation of the rules.  Now that same resident is driving even louder through the park to spite the landlord.  What can the landlord do?  Can he evict sooner, since the same violation has occurred before the 30 notice expired?  How do you handle a violation within this 30 day period?  I understand that after 30 days you can give a 20 day notice <strong>(MHCO Form 44)</strong> that is non curable if substantially the same violation occurs again within 6 months. </p><br><br>",963,997,1580,16521,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Violations Continue Under 30-Day Notice,"<p>Answer:        In theory, you should be able to give a 20-day non-curable notice within the 30 days if the same violation occurs.  This is because the law provides that the 20-day notice may be issued if substantially the same violation occurs within six months of the date of issuance of the 30-day notice.  A few years ago, the law measured the six month period from the end of the 30-day period.  However, the law was changed a few years ago, and it would  seem that now  you should not  have to  wait until  expiration of the  30-day period   before issuing a  20-day notice.  Otherwise, after the first 30-day notice, the tenant could speed through the park with impunity for the entire 30 days and the landlord could do nothing until the violation occurred again.  This result makes no sense.  However, there is a related situation which gives a different result:  What if the violation was not an ""act"" such as speeding, but a ""failure to act,"" such as not maintaining the yard?  In that case, if the tenant failed to clean up the yard within the 30-day period, the landlord would be entitled to file for eviction immediately after expiration of the 30 days and would not have to issue a 20-day notice.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1518626241,1533922000,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13502,"<br><p><strong>Question: </strong>What can the landlord do when water is obviously leaking from one of the resident's homes?

But when the community institutes a sub-metering program, everyone becomes an overnight conservationist.

Clearly, if water is visibly running out of the home, the tenants should be notified and told to fix the problem. They are responsible for their own homes.</p><br><p>As for the less obvious leaking problems, the only way to find out is to survey the tenants on the issue; e.g. do they hear the toilet leaking, for example.<a name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>Same question for faucets. Next, what about under the home? Has anyone checked lately? I have heard of management offering to do inspections under the home for free, as a part of instituting a submetering program.</p><br><p>But can you require residents take these proactive steps, especially hiring someone to inspect under the home. Except for the rules regarding the siting of home on a space, there are likely no regulations that mandate such action on an ongoing basis - at least if there is no present evidence of leaking. If there is evidence, ORS 90.740 can be relied upon to secure compliance, if nothing can be found in the rules or rental agreement:  </p><br><p><strong>90.740 Tenant obligations.</strong> A tenant shall:    </p><p><strong>(4)</strong>Except as provided by the rental agreement:</p><p>      <strong>(a)</strong>Use the rented space and the facility common areas in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended;</p><p>      <strong>(e)</strong>Install and maintain storm water drains on the roof of the dwelling or home and connect the drains to the drainage system, if any;</p><p>      <strong>(f)</strong>Use electrical, water, storm water drainage and sewage disposal systems in a reasonable manner and maintain the connections to those systems;</p><p>    </p><p>If the rules do not contain such a provision, consider amending them to add language to address the issue.

Recently representatives of Oregon Housing and Community Services (""OHCS"") were at the community and stopped by the office. They started asking for documents, copies of forms, etc. What are my rights as a manager or community owner when it comes to these types of situations?</p>",963,997,1580,15715,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: What access to documents and office do I have to provide to Oregon Housing and Community Services?,"<p>Answer: Normally, I don't like to equivocate, but here, I'm going to have to do so. I suspect this answer might be quoted to the OHCS as a reason for declining to cooperate, so want to be careful how I answer. So rather than give a definitive ""Yes"" or ""No"" I'm going to give you some things to think about, before turning over documents to anyone other than a bona fide applicant who wants to rent a space. 1. Ask yourself: ""How am I benefited by turning over my documents and forms?"" From where I sit, I see no benefit. OHCS is not applying for tenancy. If they can explain to you what good comes to your park by turning over forms that you or MHCO paid to have developed, I might change my mind. 2. Ask yourself: ""What can they do if I decline?"" OHCS describes its services and functions as follows: ""Oregon Housing and Community Services is Oregon's housing finance agency, providing financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. The current agency was created in 1991, when the legislature merged the Oregon Housing Agency with State Community Services. The coordination between housing and services creates a continuum of programs that can assist and empower lower-income individuals and families in their efforts to become self-reliant. OHCS administers federal and state antipoverty, homeless and energy assistance, and community service programs. OHCS also assists in the financing of single-family homes, the new construction or rehabilitation of multifamily affordable housing developments, as well as grants and tax credits to promote affordable housing."" These are all worthwhile and laudable goals. But I don't see anything on their website [here] suggesting that they are an enforcement or regulatory agency. So, it appears that a polite refusal to share the forms and other documents you use to operate your community will not be met by any sanction. If they can explain to you what they will do if your refuse to cooperate, and it appears they could visit upon you and your community a parade of unpleasant horribles, I might change my mind. 3. Ask yourself: ""Well, if they are not a regulatory or enforcement agency, can there be any harm in cooperating?"" In looking at their website, it is clear that part of their mission is to:  '_create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income."" Oregon law protects against discrimination in the sale, leasing or renting of housing, bases upon ""source of income."" [See, ORS 459A.421.] Today, there is a case pending before the United States Supreme Court, which will address whether discrimination arising from ""disparate impact"" is a violation of the Fair Housing laws. What is ""disparate impact?"" It means that you, as a landlord or manager, can be held to have discriminated against a member of a protected class - not because of any intent to do so - but merely because your rules, policies, or procedures in the application process, affect them more harshly than other people not in the class. It is clear from their website and stated mission, that fair housing is an important issue with the folks at OHCS. That's a good thing. But my mission is to protect - through education - MHCO's members with good risk management procedures. My experience has been that most alleged violations of fair housing laws are inadvertent, sometimes through the use of testers. That being the case, my concern in voluntarily turning over forms and documents used in managing your community, someone at OHCS might see a policy, rule, or screening criteria, that they interpret as a per se' violation of state, federal, county or city housing laws. [To put a fine point on this, go to the Fair Housing Council of Oregon's chart here, identifying the plethora of laws you are already expected to comply with, depending on the location of your community.] While I do not see that OHCS could do anything to you if they saw a potential violation, I certainly could see the documents, or information gleaned from them, being turned over to private or public entities that could do something, either through civil action or regulatory action. So, if OHCS can explain to you (a) why they need the information; (b) what they would do if they did see something they didn'tlike; and (c) what assurances they can give you that they will not turn the documents or information over to a third party for some sort of enforcement action. It they can provide you with such assurances, I might change my mind. As I have said above, OHCS's aspirational goals are laudable, and we should have no issue with them. If you want to assist in those goals, you should financially contribute to their cause. But you must also be prudent in your management decisions, balancing the risks versus the benefits, of cooperation. I see no benefits, but I do see great risks.</p>",839,1508,0,1501,1533,839,1,1380559288,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13285,"<p><strong><em>Question. </em></strong>What needs to be posted on the walls of our manager's office?

If you have them covered in the rules, that's enough -  <em>no need to shout</em>.</li>	<li>You'll notice above that I said ""<em><u>General</u></em> fair housing-type posters,"" etc.  There are several reasons: (a) There are many protected classes, and some municipalities have certain ordinances that add others.  You don't want to inadvertently miss one or more. (b) Too much information detracts from the message, which is that you follow the fair housing laws. (c) Since there is always a risk of testers coming to the office, you don't want to open up a discussion about specific protected classes, etc.</li></ul><br><p>On screening criteria I would give a cautious ""yellow"" light.  Remember there always exceptions and if made, it exposes you to complaints from others seeking the same exception.  If there are some simple, basic, criteria, e.g. 55+ rules, OK, so long as there is a proviso stating that they are general in nature, and other restrictions or limitations may apply - and direct the reader to the community rules. So not post any limits regarding occupancy, since the number of permitted occupants in a home can be dependent on the size and  number of bedrooms, and federal law is different that Oregon law. Do not include income formulas, etc., since source of income, e.g. is protected, and you don't want to post incorrect information.</p><br><p>If you have a community-wide ""no marijuana"" policy, I'm generally OK with posting it, but make it's vetted by your attorney.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1485361892,1512942461,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,277,"<p>Question: A landlord recently issued a fine to a resident for not cleaning up his yard.

What follows is a brief summary: (1) A landlord may not charge a fee at the beginning of the tenancy for an anticipated expense (i.e. one that has not actually occurred). (2) A landlord may not require the payment of any fee except as provided in this statute. (3) The specific fee must be described in a written rental agreement. (4) The following list are the fees a landlord may charge: a. A late rent payment, pursuant to ORS 90.260. b. A dishonored check, pursuant to ORS 30.701 (5). [Note that the amount of the fee may not exceed the amount described in ORS 30.701 (5) plus any amount that a bank has charged the landlord for processing the dishonored check.] c.

The violation of a written pet agreement or rule relating to pets in a facility, pursuant to ORS 90.530. e. The abandonment or relinquishment of a home during a fixed term tenancy without cause. [Note that the fee may not exceed one and one-half times the monthly rent. A landlord may not assess a fee under this section if the abandonment or relinquishment is pursuant to ORS 90.453 (2) (Termination of tenant who is victim of domestic violence), ORS 90.472 (Termination of tenant who is called to active state service) or ORS 90.475. (Termination of tenant sue to service with Armed Forces)] f. If the landlord assesses a fee under (e) above: i. The landlord may not recover unpaid rent for any period of the fixed term tenancy beyond the date that the landlord knew or reasonably should have known of the abandonment or relinquishment; ii. The landlord may not recover damages related to the cost of renting the dwelling unit to a new tenant; and iii. ORS 90.410 (3) (Effect of tenant failure to give notice of absence) does not apply to the abandonment or relinquishment. (5) Noncompliance with written rules or policies. [Note that the fee may not exceed $50.] (6) A fee may be assessed under paragraph (5), above, only for the following types of noncompliance: a. The late payment of a utility or service charge that the tenant owes the landlord as described in ORS 90.315. b. Failure to clean up pet waste from the tenant's space other than the home itself. c. Failure to clean up garbage, rubbish and other waste from the tenant's space other than the home itself. d. Parking violations. e. The improper use of vehicles within the premises. (7) A landlord is not required to account to a tenant for, or return to, the tenant any fee. (8) Except where the tenant abandons or relinquishes the space during a fixed term tenancy [see (4) e above], a landlord may not charge a tenant any form of liquidated damages, however designated. [Note: A liquidated damage is a pre-fixed amount that doesn'tnecessarily relate directly to the actual amount of damages suffered by the landlord] (9) Nonpayment of a fee is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent - but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause.

The applicable statute is ORS 90.630 (Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent.)  In summary, the statute provides that a landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy by giving to the resident not less than 30 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination. There are several types of violations listed, but the one addressing your question is subsection (1)(a):  '_a material noncompliance with ORS 90.740... .""</p><p>ORS 90.740 (3)(j) requires that the resident ""behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors."" </p><p>The text of ORS 90.630 that directly addresses your question is found at subsection (4):</p><p>""The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy <em><u>by correcting the violation <strong>within </strong>the 30-day period</u></em> ... ."" (Emphasis added.)</p><p>So clearly, when it comes to conduct, if the bad behavior continues during the 30-day period, the 30-day notice is violated the moment it re-occurs ""within the 30-day period"".  Thus, if after receiving the 30-day notice, the resident repeats what he was told <em><u>not</u></em> to do, you do not have to permit the bad behavior to continue for 29 more days - you may file immediately.  To take a more serious example, suppose the tenant was speeding through the community, endangering the other residents. Certainly, if that continues during the 30-day period, it has not been ""cured"" and you may file the F.E.D.</p><p>However, out of an abundance of caution (at least when the violation does not endanger the health, safety and welfare of the other residents) you might consider allowing the repeat violations to re-occur a couple of times, just to make sure you've got clear evidence of an intentional disregard for the 30-day notice.</p><p>Also, note that ORS 90.630(3) requires that the 30-day notice state  '_facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the reasons for termination of the tenancy and state that the tenant may avoid termination by correcting the violation... .""  This requires that you be very clear, both in explaining in the notice the nature of the violation, and exactly what steps must occur to avoid termination.</p><p>I suspect the confusion about whether a landlord must wait the full thirty days before filing for eviction arises because when the violation does not involve conduct, but relates, say, to a static violation, such as a failure to maintain the space, the full thirty days must be observed. That is, the resident has the full 30-day period to cure, e.g. cleaning the yard, or removing dilapidated furniture from the street view.</p><p>To put it another way, when the conduct requires that the resident ""stop"" doing something, the affirmative act of doing it <em>within the 30-day period</em> is, per se' a violation of ORS 90.630(4); but when the 30-day notice requires that he ""commence and complete"" a certain activity, it must be done within the entire 30-day period. If it is not completed within the 30-days, only then may the eviction be filed.</p>",23,1508,0,1501,1533,23,1,1468437381,1533925429,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13417,"<div><br></div><p>Q:        After filing a 72-hour notice for nonpayment of rent, the landlord obtained a judgement of restitution by default, since the tenant failed to appear in court.

For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. [Emphasis mine.]</p><p>Unfortunately, in close cases, what is ""outrageous"" is frequently in the eyes of the beholder. The question is was this truly an isolated incident for which you could give a 30-day notice that he could cure by simply not repeated within the following 30 days? If he repeated it thereafter [i.e. within 6 months following the date of the 30-day notice] you could terminate with a 20-day, non-curable, notice.</p><p>In making a decision whether to do a 24-hour notice, which is non-curable, or a 30-day notice which is, you should consider the following factors:</p><p>1. Has this ever occurred before?</p><p>2. How long has the resident been in the park?</p><p>3. Is there a reason to believe the conduct will be repeated?</p><p>4. Does the resident have a drinking/emotional problem on a regular basis?</p><p>5. Did the conduct pose any immediate threat to health or safety?</p><p>6. Was actual violence involved?</p><p>If you genuinely believe that a 30-day notice would work, it will still provide you with the opportunity to issue a 20-day non-curable notice if he fell off the wagon again - either within the 30 days or within 180 days following the date of issuance of the 30 day notice. Remember that the 24-hour notice is final, whereas the 30-day notice is not, because it can be ""cured."" This may be a case where you should issue the 30-day notice, and make it clear to him that the next time will be final.

Remember to be consistent and apply this approach across the board to ALL tenant applicants. To be absolutely safe, I would even go so far as to say that the list - if one can be developed - should be given to all applicants with the rest of the park's paperwork. In other words, don't ask the applicant if they have a SSN, and if they do not, then refuse to give them an application. If there are comparable alternatives that a screening company will accept, then you may use one of them.    </span></span></p><p style=""margin: 0px; text-align: justify; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; color: rgb(71, 71, 71); min-height: 14px;""> </p><p style=""margin: 0px; text-align: justify; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; color: rgb(71, 71, 71);""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">As to the question whether <i>not </i>requiring SSNs as part of the application process could open a community up to liability from the other residents, I'm not sure that is an issue.

Temporary occupants cannot occupy the premises alone.  Here's my thinking:</p><br><ul>	<li>The temporary occupancy law does not contemplate that the person residing at the premises will be paying rent. That is why landlords may not pre-qualify temporary occupants based upon their financial capacity. If that was the intent in this case, you should have had the person apply for tenancy and become a co-tenant.</li>	<li>Accordingly, you should not accept rent from the temporary occupant.</li>	<li>You should try to find out who the next of kin are and learn what they intend to do with the home;</li>	<li>It's possible, perhaps that if the estate wants to sell the home (which they have a right to do) the temporary occupant can purchase it and apply for tenancy (he/she should not complete any purchase until they qualify for tenancy).</li>	<li>Otherwise, if the temporary occupant can make arrangements to vacate within a reasonable time (e.g. a couple of weeks) you can agree to this, perhaps in a short written agreement, but it should not accompany the payment of rent;</li>	<li>Technically, the space was rented out until the end of the month, so not accepting rent for a few days into the following month should not be a hardship to you.  Moreover under the abandonment statutes, once you issue a 45-day abandonment letter to the proper parties representing the estate, it is responsible for payment of the storage fee (which may not exceed current rent) going forward until removal or resale during the ensuing twelve months.

Use of the term ""children"" is a <em>trigger </em>word, no different than use of any other label for a person in a protected class. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) treats children as ""small adults"" for purposes of scrutinizing rules.</p><p>The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) created a new protected class of ""familial status"". In California, the federal courts have addressed this requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class.</p><p><strong>Federal Requirements and Over-Regulation </strong></p><p>Let's face it; some parents are not responsible. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of all children one to four years old who died from an unin- tentional injury, almost 30% died from drowning. Fatal drowning remains the second-leading cause of unintentional injury-related death for children ages one to 14 years. The same report reveals that ""the fatal drowning rate of African American children ages 5 to 14 is 3.1 times that of white children in the same age range.""</p><p>1. E.g., <em>United States v. Plaza Mobile Estates, </em>273 F.Supp.2d 1084 (C.D. Cal. 2003); Bischoff v. Brittain, No. 2:14-cv-01970-KJM-CKD, United States District Court, E.D. California (May, 2016).</p><br><p>Mobilehome park swimming pools are deemed public, and re- quire fencing, postings and related equipment. In years past, it was believed that parkowners could require adult supervision in the swimming pool area, but it is for the parents to decide and control.</p><p><strong>State Requirements and Conflict with the FHAA and the FEHA</strong></p><p>California, meanwhile, promulgated modifications to Title 24, but apparently did not clear their proposals with any lawyer or the children's rights lobby. The state mandated sign includes language mandated by Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, as follows:</p><p>""WARNING: NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY Children under the age of 14 shall not use pool without a parent or adult guardian in attendance.""</p><p>This language is a prima facie violation of the FHAA protections against discrimination on the basis of familial rights.2 Posting this sign places every operator of a Title 22 swimming pool (that's us parkowners) in violation of the FHAA. If posted, any aggrieved family member may sue just because it is posted (enforced or not). <em>Since posting this sign exposes a parkowner to liability, what should the parkowner do? </em>First, offer to post the sign which would be consistent with the FHAA:</p><p>""WARNING: NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY Children under the age of 14 should not use pool without a parent or adult guardian in attendance; management recommends no one swim alone.""</p><p>Despite entreaties made for clarification to resolve this conflict, to both the Department of Housing and Community Development (HUD) and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), there has been no response. This problem does not lie in an older persons (55+) park, by the way. This is because the ""older persons"" park is exempt from the familial status requirements. Since a parkowner may entirely exclude children due to the effect of the 55+ regulation, allowing kids at all is a benefit that is not required (total exclusions, pool hours, supervision are all allowable restrictions) all permissible in the ""older persons"" community at this time.</p><br><p>2 . In striking down the legal requirement for signage as a discrimination defense, the central district judge held that "" . . . there is nothing magical about the age of 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement."" <em>U.S. v. Plaza Mobile Estates. </em></p><br><br><p>In many counties, the illicit requirement is not applicable until capital renovation of the pool area. But if not, what do you do if the county representative refuses to consent to the suggested modification? Do you refuse to comply with state law in order to comply with the FHAA, or do you comply with the state mandate and violate the FHAA? As of this time, you must seek out counsel, pay them, obtain advice, and follow it.</p><p><strong>Management Communications Can Violate the FHAA</strong></p><p>In a housing case decided in Northern California in May, 2016, the landlord was called out for discrimination against children in an all age facility. In <em>Bischoff v. Brittain,</em>3 the on site management received training, including a ""Resident Relations Training,"" at seminars pro- vided by independent experts. A ""Brief Recap of Notes"" document summarizes several meetings and was distributed to the managers. The document stated that as to handling unsupervised children:</p><p>1. If you have a young child not being supervised, walk the child home and speak with whoever is in charge.</p><p>2. Have your supervisor write a letter after you speak with the person in the apartment, which will alert whoever opens the mail, that you are worried over the child's safety-you are now showing safety concerns and are not attacking their parenting skills or being discriminatory.</p><ol>	<li value=""3"">If nothing changes and the child is once again outside un- supervised, notify your super- visor who will now contact so- cial services and/or the police. </li>	<li value=""4"">If nothing still changes, we will then consider eviction and note the reasoning on their notice. </li></ol><p>The landlord's property director said the document is ""simply a statement of suggested guidelines for the managers' reference and discretionary application to unsupervised young children."" However, the court found that the reasoning violates ""familial status"" rights. The director relied on a mistaken understanding that ""young children require regular adult super- vision."" She felt that management should ""encourage [...] parents and guardians to exercise such supervision for the safety of their young children and for the benefit of other residents."" She believed that ""such supervision is necessary so that young children who are tenant residents ""will not be at risk of injuring themselves"" or other residents, or ""engaging in disruptive or destructive activities.""</p><p>""In an effort to promote such supervision and discourage parent-guardian neglect, we developed internal suggested guidelines for managers to use in their discretion as circumstances might war- rant.""</p><p>3. U.S.Dist.E.D.Ca. April 29, 2016, Decided; May 2, 2016, No. 2:14-cv-01970-KJM-CKD, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58280.</p><br><br><p>The guidelines do not pass muster, said the court. While intended to protect the safety and well-being of young children in need of supervision, to encourage parents or guardians to provide that needed supervision, and to limit disturbances to other residents, they also allow <em>differential treatment</em>. It is no help that the guidelines serve the concomitant business purpose of protecting against liability that might arise from injuries to such young children.</p><p>The court found that the landlord's policies ""[...] toward unsupervised young children inherently treats children differently than adults by limiting when they may use the common areas of the complex to times when they are supervised by an adult."" The guidelines also treat parents of young children differently by subjecting them to certain consequences if their children are found unsupervised. Adult-only households may use the complex without limitation and warnings or facing eviction for violating the adult supervision guidelines. Be- cause children are subjected to explicitly differential treatment there was a validly claimed discrimination based on the face of the guide- lines.</p><p>The landlord claimed the guide- lines are not discriminatory: they are not a formalized, mandatory ""policy"" or rental provision; they only limit young children to the ex- tent the children are unsupervised; they apply only to young children; they have nondiscriminatory justifications; and they originated from a ""neutral"" source (educational sources). <strong>The court replied that the landlord <em>did not understand the law</em>: </strong>""[...]to establish a prima facie case of facial discrimination, a plaintiff must show only that the defendant subjects a protected group to explicitly differential treatment""4. But the landlord did not dispute that it treated unsupervised young children and their parents differently than adults sans children.</p><p>The guidelines were violations even if just ""[l]imiting the use of privileges and facilities [which] is a violation of [_ 3604(b)]."" The court also found it irrelevant that the guidelines distilled ""neutral"" information. The courts have held that ""all-age"" park rules which: (i) treat kids differently; (ii) are not based on a ""compelling business necessity"" and (iii) did not represent the ""least restrictive intrusions"" on familial status rights in promoting a health and safety interest, violate the law.</p><p>Any age restrictive rules which treat children, (and thus, families with children), differently and less favorably than adults-only house- holds violate the law. Period. In other words, no matter how ad- ministered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced, such rules may lead to a resident's belief about allowable restrictions in use of the facilities. And now, the right to sue extends to internal policies handed down to on site personnel.</p><p>4. Citing <em>Community House, Inc. v. City of Boise </em>(9th Cir. 2007) 490 F.3d 1041 at 1050.</p><br><br><p><strong>Safeguards Against Harm? </strong></p><p>Well-meant intentions are no defense, said the court. The court noted that the landlord submitted no evidence that managers were told to apply the policy only if a young child's safety was threatened, or that managers in practice applied the policy in such a way. Land- lord also said, diluting the safety defense, that one of the ""primary goals"" of the guidelines is to limit disturbances to other residents by children, which ""likely encompasses situations beyond those in which a child's safety is legitimately threatened."" Peace and quiet is not a licit basis for the special treatment of children. Broad exclusionary policies without very particular narrowly tailored terms will be struck down. No cases specify what those narrow, least intrusive regulations might look like. And, it is submitted that seeking to develop children-specific rules is so fraught with difficulty and exposure as not to be worth the time and effort. Again, let the parents and guardians decide.</p><p><strong>Eliminate the Exposure You May Have: </strong></p><p>Scour on-site management directives, policy handbooks, instructions, procedures manuals, emails. In other words, audit your intermediate level of management documentation; the entire body of memorialized supervision instructions, policies and requirements that apply to on site management. Do your employment agreements contain your fair housing policy? Do your agreements prohibit discriminatory statements, actions, conduct, communications, jokes, or notices? None of these documents is privileged from the prying eye of the plaintiff class counsel. It may be time to update these documents.</p><p><strong>Remember: requiring adult supervision is NOT allowed in all age parks. </strong></p><p>An adult supervision requirement is outlawed by several decisions citing <em>United States v. Plaza Mo- bile Estates: </em>it is the parents, not management, who act as the ""gate- keepers"" of the facilities including swimming pool access and usage of facilities in ""all age"" communities. Requiring any form of super- vision constitutes a violation of the FHAA.</p><p><strong><em>The FHAA Examples of Improper Rules to Update </em></strong></p><p>Rules and regulations in ""all age"" communities which discriminate include the following.

In other words, no matter how ad- ministered, the rules were invalid as drafted. <em>Even if never enforced</em>, such rules may lead to a resident's belief about allowable restrictions in use of the facilities.</p><p><strong>The FFHA </strong></p><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Federal Fair Housing Act (""FFHA"") to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability or national origin, but also included ""familial status"" discrimination. ""Familial status"" is defined as ""one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals."" Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p>""<em>To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status .</em>..""</p><p>Thus, in an all-age community, restrictions on access or use of common facilities and amenities based on age of a child (""familial status"") is a violation of the FHAA, absent ""compelling business necessity."" 5 Any such rule must be proved to be the ""least restrictive means"" to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this <em>legalese </em>mean to the parkowner in practical terms? A full blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards</p><p>or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case de- pends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a ""test-case."" In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>""Children"" are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHAA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" How does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident. . ."" Obviously, such a rule would violate the FHAA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference for certain types of ten- ants. Another issue is the use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. It is a violation to place ads that specify a preference for: ""mature ten- ants,"" stating an aversion to ""families with children, teenagers in the building; advertisements stating no more than ""one child,"" or stating that the parkowner does not ""rent to children."" ""Adult Community"" at the entrance to a non-exempt com- munity also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without in- dicating it is housing for older per- sons, constitutes a violation of the</p><p>FHAA. There are no such things as ""adult"" mobilehome parks, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p>The court held that these rules were not based on ""compelling business necessity"" and did not represent the ""least restrictive"" intrusions on ""familial status"" rights in promoting a health and safety interest. Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the <em>Plaza Mobile Estates </em>case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs. While the action was brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected tenants could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated that the age restrictive rules were ""facially"" discriminatory. In other words, no matter how ad- ministered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy.</p><p><strong>What Can We Do to Avoid This Mine Field? </strong></p><p>Even in the absence of specific rules and the ability to craft them, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with the very youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a parkowner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.), the parkowner is providing a service - disseminating information and facts - not discriminating against children. 6</p><p><strong><em>Conclusion </em></strong></p><p>All the parkowner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is that certain rules are not permissible. Does it make any practical sense to promulgate new regula- tions affecting treatment of children? No.</p><p>The best policy for the all-age park is to have no references to children, child, adult, or other words which suggest differential treatment be-tween adults and children. The de- cisions affecting the young are for the parents to decide on.</p><p>Even with neutral rules and regulations, the enforcement of the rules needs to be considered. Does your manager have different attitudes, tone, manner or demeanor in general in dealing with kids and their parents? There is no room for derogatory comments, insults, or force beyond the same level applied to parents and other childless adults. Our mantra: Professional- ism. First and always! Ñ </p><p>5. Some cases phrase the test differently (least restrictive, narrowly tailored, not speculative, etc.), but the reader is best advised to apply the standards applicable to the most stringent precedents in effect at this time, until variations on the articulation of the proper test for rules is made judicially and clear through further appellate court development. This is what plaintiff lawyers do. They will make the claim that the rules do not pass muster under the most difficult of possible tests. If you wish to preclude court tests of your rules, they will be drafted based on clearing the highest possible legal hurdles.</p><p>6. For example, educational material exist which explain that young children have peripheral vision which is two-thirds that of an adult; they have difficulty determining the source of sounds; traffic noises and sirens may be confusing; they may not understand that an automobile may seriously hurt or kill them; most children cannot understand a complex chain of events; children believe that all grownups will look out for them; they think that if they can see an adult driving a car toward them, the driver must be able to see them; children often mix fantasy with reality - they may give themselves superhuman powers and do not understand that a moving vehicle can hurt them; they have difficulty judging the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles.</p><br><p>Terry R.

And mistakes in understanding the law frequently work <em>against</em> landlords.  The basic rule-of-thumb to remember is that the written document which defines the landlord-tenant relationship must be complete <u>and</u> must be followed.  While Oregon law does contain some restrictions upon what landlords can put into their rental agreements,<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> generally, they are far better off commencing the rental relationship with a strong, clear and fair written document.   MHCO has gone to great lengths in making sure that its forms meet these criteria.  What follows is a list of ten tips and traps to remember when using the MHCO Rental Agreement form.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16250,column,und,Property Management - Tips and Traps,"<ol>	<li><strong>Make sure that the rental agreement really applies to your situation.</strong>  The MHCO rental agreement comes in two flavors: (a) The month-to-month (or ""periodic"") rental agreement, and (b) the lease (or fixed term) agreement.  The difference is that the month-to-month agreement runs for 30 days at a time.  In the absence of termination, the periodic tenancy just ""rolls over"" month to month.  Regardless of which agreement is used, landlords renting or leasing spaces to residents in mobile home parks may generally not terminate them without cause.  However, a lease for at least two years carries a distinct advantage in that the park documents, i.e. the lease agreement and the park rules, may be <em>automatically</em> updated at the end of each lease term.  While there are certain limitations upon the landlord's right to impose new park documents on the resident, it is clearly much easier to do under a lease than a monthly rental agreement. <a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>  Also, landlords using a</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">fixed term lease agreement must expressly incorporate any rent increase provisions into the written agreement.  The rent increase statute, ORS 90.600, applies <em>only</em> to periodic (e.g. month-to-month) tenancies and not fixed term tenancies.  If the home located upon the space is a recreational vehicle rather than a manufactured home, landlords should <em>not</em> use the standard mobile home space rental agreement.  The reason is that the mobile home park section of the landlord-tenant law does not apply to recreational vehicles.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>  When renting space for a recreational vehicle, landlords should use an appropriate RV rental form.</p><p style=""margin-left:.25in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""2""><strong>Make sure that the rental agreement is signed by <em>all</em> adult tenants who will occupy the space.</strong>  This not only financially obligates them under the agreement, but it makes it easier to enforce violations against rules offenders.  Do not permit occupancy of a home until the rental agreement has been fully signed by everyone.  Trying to get signatures after-the-fact can be difficult, if not impossible.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3""><strong>Make sure that the Statement of Policy, Rules, and Rental Agreement are given to the resident and properly receipted for.</strong>  Occasionally, residents deny receiving one or more of these documents.  However, the signed receipt by the resident is legal evidence of delivery of these documents.  ORS 90.510(9) provides that a signed receipt is a defense to a claim against the landlord for nondelivery of these documents.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4""><strong>Similarly, landlords should make sure that the rights they summarize in the Statement of Policy accurately reflect their rental agreement and rules.</strong>  When using the MHCO forms this is not a problem.  It could be, however, when different forms from different sources are used, and the Statement of Policy provides that the resident has (or does not have) certain rights that are not consistent with those found in the rental agreement or rules. The Statement of Policy is not intended to be a binding legal document.  It is supposed to merely summarize the rights and duties of the resident which are found in the rental agreement or rules.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""5""><strong>Understand the rights given you under the rental agreement form.</strong>  Not knowing your rights can result in not enforcing violations, which can lead to a waiver of those rights.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""6""><strong>One of the more important provisions of the rental agreement form is the one which prohibits assignment, subletting or transfer of possession of the agreement or space without the landlord's prior written consent.</strong>  Landlords should make sure that when a resident vacates, leaving a guest or visitor at the space, immediate action is taken to either terminate the tenancy or require that the occupant promptly apply for tenancy by filling out all required documentation.  Do not accept rent from the occupant, the ex-tenant, or on the occupant's behalf, until the issue has been thoroughly resolved.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""7""><strong>Be aware that the fire insurance provision does <em>not</em> apply unless it is specifically checked:</strong>  It requires that the resident must maintain a homeowner's policy of insurance that includes coverage for fire in an amount sufficient to replace the home, and permits the landlord to request a current copy of the policy.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""8""><strong>Similarly, landlords should be sure to have the resident initial those portions of the rental agreement which require them to do so. </strong> There are several such places found in the sections dealing with (a) sale of the home and (b) the resident's legal obligations under the tenancy.  When these sections are not properly initialed, there remains an argument that it is not binding.  Although such an argument would not likely carry the day, it can be avoided entirely by simply making sure that when the agreement is signed, all internal provisions are properly completed, checked and initialed where appropriate.</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.25in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""9""><strong>The landlord's rights upon a resident's resale are very important and need to be fully understood by both parties.</strong>  One such section of the resale portion of the rental agreement provides that in the event the resident (or their predecessors) has/have made any improvements or alterations to the interior or exterior of the home which did not conform to all applicable local, state and federal building codes or ordinances in existence at the time the work was performed, the landlord has the right to require, as a condition of consent to the sale, that such improvement or alteration be brought up to all applicable local, state and federal building and construction standards in existence at the time of the sale.  When homes have been substantially remodeled, especially where electrical or plumbing systems are involved, this provision may be useful for the landlord to enforce in order to make sure that the proper building codes are followed.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""10""><strong>Disputes are an inevitable part of being a landlord.</strong>  MHCO believes that assigning fault is less important that securing a workable resolution.  Landlords should be aware that Oregon law requires them to have a informal dispute resolution process in their rental agreement.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>   The MHCO form provides that in the event of any dispute regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the rental agreement or the rules and regulations, either party shall have the right to have the matter handled through the alternative dispute resolution (""ADR"") process set forth in the attached MHCO Addendum, which is incorporated into the agreement.

When I served it she told me that she is a victim of domestic violence and would provide me a copy of the restraining order, she also told me that she would have her attorney contact me. Neither occurred. She paid her rent by the final date on the notice. She hasn't paid rent yet this month. I still have no copies of a restraining order, nor has her husband informed me that he has moved out. She is the only one to tell me about domestic violence. I just served her with another 72 hour notice. She is upset and yelled that I can't evict her because she is still dealing with issues as a victim of domestic violence. She also told me that she now has two attorneys and that she will have them both call me. I informed her to read the notice carefully as rent will need to be paid by the 13th or I would file in court on the 14th.</p><p>My question is this: Is domestic violence a recognized defense to non-payment of rent?<br /> </p><br>",959,994,1580,16554,column,und,Querin Q&A: Is Domestic Violence a Defense to Non-Payment of Rent?,"<p><strong><em>Answer:  </em></strong>Domestic violence is a defense to eviction, but only under the proper circumstances.  I have set out the law in its entirety below. As you can see, the law presumes there has been a violent act for which the landlord is evicting <em>everyone</em>in the space, i.e. the villain and the victim.  The domestic violence law says you cannot evict the victim for the violent act. But it also says the villain and the victim are still responsible for rent.  It also requires a valid third-party affirmation to the event.  </p><br><p>In short, based on your question, it does not sound as if the domestic violence statute will provide a defense to an action for nonpayment of rent.  You should tell the victim that you do not believe the domestic violence law applies in these circumstances (i.e. nonpayment of rent) and that if her attorney believes otherwise, he must call you immediately and explain why. Is she is a serial late pay for which you have to issue multiple non-payment of rent notices, you might consider a 3-strikes notice under <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">ORS 90.630(8)</a>.</p><br><p align=""center""><strong><u>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STALKING</u></strong></p><br><p><strong>      90.445 Termination of tenant committing criminal act of physical violence.</strong> (1) If a tenant perpetrates a criminal act of physical violence related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking against a household member who is a tenant, after delivery of at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the act or omission constituting the cause and specifying the date and time of the termination, the landlord may:</p><p>      (a) Terminate the rental agreement of the perpetrating tenant, but may not terminate the rental agreement of the other tenants; and</p><p>      (b) If the perpetrator of the criminal act of physical violence related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking continues to occupy the premises after the termination date and time specified in the notice, seek a court order under ORS 105.128 to remove the perpetrator from the premises and terminate the perpetrator's tenancy without seeking a return of possession from the remaining tenants.</p><p>      (2) A landlord that terminates the tenancy of a perpetrator under this section may not require the remaining tenants to pay additional rent or an additional deposit or fee due to exclusion of the perpetrator.</p><p>      (3) The perpetrator is jointly liable with any other tenants of the dwelling unit for rent or damages to the premises incurred prior to the later of the date the perpetrator vacates the premises or the termination date specified in the notice.</p><p>      (4) The landlord's burden of proof in a removal action sought under this section is by a preponderance of the evidence.

If the landlord advertises a home for sale in the community, the tenants are permitted to post their signage in a similar manner and location. </span></p><ol>	<li value=""2""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Landlords may not knowingly make false statements to prospective purchasers about the quality of a tenant's home.<a name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></span></li>	<li value=""3""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Note that landlords <em><u>are </u></em>permitted to sell homes to prospective purchasers on more favorable prices and terms than those offered by tenants.</span></li></ol><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">ORS 90.710 provides that any  person aggrieved  by a violation of 90.680 has a cause of action against the violator for any damages sustained as a result  of  the violation  or  $200, <em><u> whichever is  greater. </u></em>If a person violates ORS 90.680 three or more times within a 24-month period, a person aggrieved thereby has a cause of action against the violator for any damages sustained as a result of the third or subsequent violation or $500, <em><u>whichever is greater</u></em>.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Note, however, that the statute of limitations for all violations of Oregon's residential landlord-tenant act, is only one year. Accordingly, similar to violations under the Unlawful Trade Practices Act, time to take action is critical.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><em><u>Plugging the Holes</u></em><em>.</em>It is important to note that the conduct reported in the news article occurred well before ORS 90.680 was beefed up in 2016. Based solely upon my reading, had the acts complained of occurred today, they would have constituted potential violations of that statute.  For example, the following holes are plugged:</span></p><br><ol>	<li><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">A written consignment agreement is now required, outlining the duties of the consignor, and rights of the seller, including such things as the form of compensation for the consignor.</span></li>	<li><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Now the consignor must be licensed, and would become subject to ORS 446.661 to 446.756, and the administrative rules of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services<a name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>; that does not appear to have been the case with the on-site manager/regional manager named in the article. Plus, having a licensee gives the DCBS further power to sanction.<a name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a></span></li>	<li><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">A written accounting of the proceeds must now be provided, thus avoiding what was alleged in the article, which claimed that the homes were sold for much higher prices than reported to the owners, with the seller retaining undisclosed proceeds. </span></li></ol><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">However, as is often the case, regardless of how well it is written, the law cannot always prevent abuses, such as a licensed consignor, within the 180-day period, intentionally delaying a sale in order to encourage the tenant to drop the price and eventually sell to the manager or related party.  However, until it appears that ORS 90.680, in its present form, is actually being abused, I would avoid the temptation of fixing something legislatively that has not yet posed a problem.<a name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a></span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">The take-away here is that community residents must be vigilant not only for their own protection, but their neighbors, as well. </span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Of course, the above laws relate to private rights of action; the State of Oregon itself has enforcement powers that include actions under the Unlawful Trade Practices Act. The Oregon Department of Justice administers this law.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Next, what came to mind in reading the article was the law of ""<em>respondeat superior</em>"". This is a fancy law school term imposing liability on companies for the conduct of their employees. If an employee injures someone either negligently or intentionally, the employer has, in most cases, liability. Why? Because of the public policy that companies and employers in the business of providing goods and services, have the ability to insure against such misconduct. It is simply a ""cost of doing business"" to the employer, who can recoup the expense in the cost of goods and services. </span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">In the article, it appeared that the Chicago company attempted to distance itself from its regional manager whose conduct was allegedly the subject of resident complaints. Ostensibly, the company said this person ‰ÛÒ who was no longer affiliated with it ‰ÛÒ was an ""independent contractor"". The inference was that since the regional manager was an independent contractor, and not an employee, <em>respondeat </em><em>superior </em>didn't apply ‰ÛÒ in other words, the company was not responsible (read: ""liable"") for the conduct of the person(s) that allegedly caused harm.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">For this company, as most companies, the ""independent contractor"" safe harbor, doesn't exist. It's a bit surprising that a large national company allegedly said this, since the argument has little merit, and is easily disproven.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">It is noteworthy that the type of conduct alleged in the article is not confined to manufactured housing communities. It is endemic to all situations in which seniors live and work; there will always be those whose moral compass falls short of true north. </span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">However, as noted above, protections do exist.  Although, several of the persons interviewed for the article expressed concern about hiring an attorney, there are legal services, such as Legal Aid, that can provide assistance. There are also, law firms specializing in elder care matters. There are firms that set low rates, and/or, will secure attorney fees from the other side. </span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">In the case covered by the Register-Guard, I cannot help but believe there are a bevy of private firms, as well as Legal Aid, and the Oregon Department of Justice, who are available and ready to help.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">And to the resident who did not want the stress of bringing a claim, let me suggest that the more egregious a case is, the quicker it will be settled by the defense attorneys. Their interest is for the matter to get out of the public spotlight, and the only way to make that happen is to settle as quickly as possible. Cases such as these rarely see the inside of a courtroom.</span></p><br><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Lastly, as noted above, the take-away is for everyone who learns of a senior being taken advantage of, to provide compassionate assistance and direction to available legal resources, so the victim knows there are others out there who can and will help. In the case reported by the Register-Guard, there were already plenty of laws in place ‰ÛÒ and even more today, including a beefed-up version of ORS 90.680. We just need to do a better job in getting the word out.  </span></p><br><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><a name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a>MHCO published a summary of the new law in 2016, when it went into effect.</span></p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><a name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a>ORS 90.100(24) defines a ""landlord"" as:  '_the owner, lessor or sublessor of the dwelling unit or the building or premises of which it is a part.

Each management team has allowed a few families to move in believing the community was well within the 20% margin allowed by Federal Fair Housing regulations.  Unfortunately, a few of the original residents have had a death in the family leaving the youngest (younger than 55) resident remaining as the head of household. An annual age survey of the residents has not been maintained by either of the on-site management teams.  A prospective resident (younger than 55) has now been denied as a new tenant and is challenging the 55 plus status of the Community.  Without an accurate age survey of the existing residents how is the Community/Owner going to prove the Community satisfies the Federal Fair Housing requirements of a 55 plus Community ? This Community/Owner in all probability will  face costly litigation while attempting to collect the necessary data and the Community may even lose its 55 plus status.  If the on-site manager/owner had completed an annual age survey of the residents this costly experience could have been avoided.  Does your 55 plus community have a current ""age survey""?  </p><br><p>MHCO has a number of forms for 55 and Older Communities:</p><br><ul>	<li><strong>MHCO Form 71A:  </strong>Addendum to the Rental/Lease Agreement for Age 55 &amp; Older Communities </li>	<li><strong>MHCO Form 71B:  </strong>55 &amp; Older Community Occupancy Determination and Age Verification </li>	<li><strong>MHCO Form 71C:  </strong>HUD Verification of Occupancy Survey </li></ul><br><br><p>Another example of ongoing record keeping includes updated copies of any insurance certificates naming the Community/Owner as an additional insured. If the Community requires pet owners to name the Community/Owner as an additional insured on their homeowners insurance policy an annual review of the certificates of insurance is necessary.

Reinvesting in your manufactured home community is no different. MHCs are considered one of the best forms of affordable housing, which are in short supply. Today building a new MHC is usually economically unfeasible in areas due to the restrictions being placed on them by local and state government. Therefore, it's ever more important to not let your MHC deteriorate. Being proactive by putting together a Capital Improvement budget and developing a reserve account is a good idea. Depending on the age of your community the capital improvements will vary from sewer lines, water lines, resurfacing the roads, replacing cracked sidewalks, and club house remodeling.</p>",959,994,1580,15898,column,und,Reinvesting In Capital Projects In Your Community,"<p>Although not a true capital expenditure; computer hardware, software and peripherals do not last forever. Deciding when is the right time to replace them or upgrade is always a difficult decision. Will upgrading increase productivity? A new system can affect productivity in positive ways. In today's business environment many users have more applications open at one time and a new system with increased speed will have a positive effect on managing the time spent moving between applications. One of the obvious reasons to upgrade is your operating system is probably running Windows XP which was released to the market in 2001 and support for this system is no longer available. So not upgrading isn't even an option, it's a cost of doing business today. Advances in computers and software dictate that every few years you are going to need to make some upgrades. If you are eight years behind, this becomes a more formidable task and a larger learning curve. It's far better to continually upgrade your systems. The expense will be the same in the long run, but the result is that you will be more productive and ease into incremental training. These are all things to consider when determining a budget for your reserve account.</p><p>There are several capital improvements that can increase the value of your MHC. Filling vacant manufactured home sites is one. A vacant home site is costing you money to keep the lawn mown, the weeds removed and lot to be cleaned, not to mention the loss of revenue. It also can cause your residents angst having an unsightly empty lot next door. Putting together a strategic plan for filling your vacancies is proactive and critical. Be creative. For example, consider looking at a vacant single wide site that may be able to fit a double wide home by setting the home back and installing a front load driveway. Another is submetering water, sewer and passing through the garbage service expense. By installing water meters at each manufactured home and billing the resident's back for water, sewer and passing through the garbage you are in effect increasing your bottom line. This is one of the most equitable ways to pass on expenses to the residents as they only pay for what they use. Commonwealth can discuss with you how to install submeters with zero investment from you, the owner. Other ideas to add value is to increase curb appeal in your community and install new and attractive signs at the entrances. Maintain adequate energy efficient lighting to save on your electric bills while also promoting safety in the community. If you have vacant land, consider developing more MH sites, RV storage or storage units.

For every one case that is reported, 24 cases go unreported (National Clearinghouse on Abuse in Late Life).  There are several factors that contribute to this.  An older adult is reluctant to admit that abuse is happening.  Guilt and shame are silencers in Elder Abuse.  Some folks do not have the capacity to report that abuse is happening.  This could be a capacity issue but also is impacted by Generational Culture.  Does the older adult know that rape in a marriage is rape? Rape in a marriage was legal until 1976.  Is the older adult comfortable talking about his or her body? Another reason cases go unreported is because no one inquires how an older person is doing with changes in their lives.  For example, when an adult child moves back in with the older person the assumption is it's a positive change.  Does the older person get asked about the change in his or her living situation? Elder abuse can also be physically hidden.  When an older adult is hurt it can go unnoticed because of the belief that bruises and falls are part of the aging process.</p>",959,994,1580,16016,column,und,"Rental Policies That Fined Families for Kids' Riding Bikes Yields Settlement - Oregon Landlord Fined $65,000","<p>While we know that anyone in a trusting relationship with the older person has the potential to be abusive, the dynamic is still predominantly intimate partner violence.  This can be a long term relationship that has had abuse occurring all throughout the history of the relationship.  Another form is a new relationship, possible post-divorce or widowed.  In this relationship an older person may have experienced abuse in the past or this may be his or her first experience with abuse.  Late Onset is a description of a relationship that has changed with an organic condition.  The abusive person could have been controlling and verbally abusive and now is physically abusive.  Or abuse may have not been present in the history of the relationship and now is, due to an organic condition such as dementia or capacity changes.  Another dynamic is a person who was abused in the past and is now abusing the abuser.  Believing, safety planning and collaboration are key in supporting the older survivor.</p><p>Take action by not letting the older folks in your lives be invisible.  Try to notice when your older neighbor isn'taround or big changes occur in his or her lives.  An adult child moving in, mobility changing, caregivers that aren'tconsistent or anyone that appears to be controlling the older person's life.  Are the same support folks coming around or has something changed? Try to give that older adult some private space to have a safe conversation.  Often, if the abuser thinks the older adult might be asking for help or telling others about the controlling behaviors, the abuser will retaliate.  This could be punishing, physically and emotionally abusing or further isolation. Connecting with your local Adult Protective Services agency, Domestic Violence Agency and Social Service Senior agencies are a key way to help the older adult.  The collaboration of these agencies can provide protection and support by the way of Elderly/Disabled Persons Abuse Prevention Act, criminal charges, emotional and resource support.</p>",839,1506,0,1502,1533,839,1,1415046847,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13541,"<p><strong><em>Generally</em></strong></p><p>The tenant application process is one of the least understood by landlords and managers.

Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted application if it is incomplete - and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned.  Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided bad information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><br><p>It is also important to note that Oregon law permits the  '_landlord and the prospective purchaser (to) agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.""  Thus, as noted on the MHCO Application form, there is a place for the landlord to insert a period longer than the statutory seven day period.  If the landlord suspects any delay, either on the applicant's part or his own part, a longer period should be inserted. If the applicant rejects this extension, then the landlord can decide whether he wants to proceed to process the application at all.</p><br><p>Note: If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' advance notice of intent to sell as required in ORS 90.680(4) (a), the landlord's seven day response time is extended to 10 days. But remember, in no instances does the landlord have to receipt and process an inaccurate or incomplete application.  It is better not to accept a defective application - or return it immediately upon finding that it is inaccurate or incomplete, than continuing to process it. </p><br><p>If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser the application the landlord <em>shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale</em>. It is important to remember that the terms of these park document given to the prospective tenant need not be the same as those in the existing (i.e. selling) tenant's documents.<a name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p><br><p><strong><em>Park Documents. </em></strong></p><br><p>Landlords and managers should always remember that when they change one of the park documents, they may have to change others. This is because of two risks: (a) The failure to incorporate a change in the lease, say, into the Statement of Policy, and (b) An inconsistency between one or more of the park documents, such as the rental agreement and the rules. Rules can generally be changed in the middle of a tenancy, but rental agreements cannot.  So landlords should remember to make sure their documents are all internally consistent.</p><br><br><br><br><p><strong><em>Fair Housing Laws.</em></strong></p><br><p>The state and federal fair housing laws are essentially - but not completely - the same.  Landlords and managers should familiarize themselves with any special ordinances found in their city or county laws.  However, Oregon law prohibits any form of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing when directed at the following protected classes:  '_race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income.""<a name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>  The easiest, best, and safest way to deal with the risk of a discrimination claim is to make all screening criteria facially neutral.  Do not have rules which - even unintentionally - could have a negative impact on a member of a protected class.  </p><br><p>In Oregon, most claims of discrimination relate to familial status.  Examples range from managers encouraging families to purchase and reside in one particular area of the community (where there are more children), to making off-hand comments to applicants (e.g. ""there would be very few children for your kids to play with here"") that may be construed as indicating a desire not to rent to people with children.  For this reason, landlords and managers should strive to apply their screening criteria <em>neutrally</em>regardless of the applicant's membership in a protected class.  </p><br><p>Additionally, caution should be exercised in answering questions over the phone, since federal and state ""testers"" have been known to test parks by making multiple phone calls asking various loaded questions, such as ""Is this a good place to raise my children?""  If the community is a family park, the best response to open-ended telephone inquiries is to tell the caller that it is a family park, open to all, and that they are welcome to come in and pick up an application for processing.</p><br><p>One of the biggest areas of concern for landlords and managers today involve issues of immigration status.  At the risk of minimizing the problem, there is one basic rule that landlords and managers should always remember when screening applicants. While it is not a ""silver bullet,"" it should help avoid the vast majority of issues regarding immigration status.  <em>Never treat any single applicant differently from another.</em>  This means that landlords should not automatically ""suspect"" that certain persons are illegally in this country and then impose more rigorous screening criteria on them alone.  It is best not to ask about immigration status.<a name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>  If the applicant passes the same screening criteria imposed upon others, and all of the information in their application checks out, you should accept the current applicant, regardless of whether you have suspicions about their immigration status. One of the frequently asked questions is whether a landlord may insist that applicants provide their social security number.  While this is not automatically illegal, <em>it can be when applied to some applicants and not others</em>.  Consistency is the name of the game.  Do not request verification in some cases and not others.  Do not accept some tenants who fail to provide the number, but accept others (who are not obviously immigrants) without also providing such proof.</p><br><p>Another area of concern is occupancy limits or extra occupancy charges.<a name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>  This is somewhat of a grey area because Oregon law currently permits a two person per bedroom rule - assuming that it is expressly listed as part of the park's screening criteria and uniformly applied.  However, the problem is that federal law contains no specific occupancy limits.  This means that, in theory, one could be in compliance with state law, while violating federal law.  For example, if a family consisted of two adults and three children who owned a 2-bedroom home, a ""2-persons per bedroom"" requirement would mean that they could not move into the park.  But if the third child was an infant who slept in the parents' room, one may ask whether this standard is reasonable, even though it complies with Oregon law.  At the risk of violating federal law, which imposes no such occupancy limits, the better approach might be to avoid the ""slippery slope"" problem entirely, by not creating occupancy limits.<a name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a>  </p><br><p>Perhaps the most difficult of screening criteria issues is in the area of assistance animals.  Since handicap is a protected class, this means that if one could establish a legitimate need for an assistance animal they could not be prevented from having one - even though the park might have a one-pet policy and this might be their second pet.  This could be so even though the animal was not trained or certified in providing assistance. MHCO has Form 15 that may be given to tenants applying for a ""reasonable accommodation"" which is the technical term used when an allegedly handicapped person requests relief from strict application of a rule that interferes with their handicapped. <a name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a>As most landlords and managers know, the handicap protections can be severely stretched.  There are many reasons for this, including, among other things, the handicap may be allegedly psychological, and the tenant has nothing more than a note from a doctor - not a treating psychologist or psychiatrist. </p><br><p>The other difficult issue is that assistant animals are not technically ""pets"" and therefore are not subject to the requirement that the Pet Agreement be completed.  Ultimately it comes down to a rule of reason and proof.  Does it appear that the person requesting the accommodation is legitimately handicapped? Do they have a known history of the handicap - that is, has it ever come up before?  Does it appear that the claim of a handicap is new, and possibly raised as a pretext, say to circumvent a one-pet policy?  </p><br><p>Ultimately, the issue comes down to public safety in the community.  For example, if the tenant wanted to have a pit bull (in violation of a dangerous breed prohibition) or a bull-mastiff (in violation of a size restriction), the landlord should ask which battle he or she wants to fight?  If the tenant isn't credible, has a history of skirting the rules on this or other issues, it might make sense to refuse and let them take the next step.  If they bring the animal into the park in light of the denial, you will have a choice; either do nothing or send out a notice of violation which would require removal of the animal.  The risk in allowing dangerous or oversized breed into the park is that it may harm someone, and then the landlord will have to defend a lawsuit for failing to enforce their own rules.  Additionally, in consenting, the precedent has been set, now permitting such animals based upon a tenant's assertion the need it for assistance.  Remember, ""reasonable accommodations"" need only be ""reasonable.""  Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><br><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><br><p><strong><em>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues</em></strong></p><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home - they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually<em>afford</em>to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid.  </li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied. Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information.  </li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible. </li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a <u>current</u>FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is <em>less.</em></li></ul><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p><br><p>Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><br><p><strong>©Copyright by Phillip C.

Depending on what it says, you may need to make some changes right away. Then review it in detail - and get help from your attorney, resident screening company, and other advisors to ensure that it complies with HUD guidelines. Richer offered some key best practices:</p>",959,994,1580,16685,column,und,Review Your Criminal Screening Criteria,"<p><strong>Remove any ban based on arrests</strong>. The first thing to do is to check whether your policy includes any ban based on arrest records, Richer said. HUD's guidance clearly states that records of arrest should not be used to deny housing or terminate a lease. There may be circumstances where a criminal event has occurred and the arrest record might justify further research into the behavior, but an arrest alone can't be used to deny housing eligibility.</p><p><strong>Include statement of the purpose served by criminal screening.</strong> When documenting your resident selection policies, include a statement that the policies serve to reduce risk to your communities and residents. As you review your policies and make adjustments, be prepared to show that your policies are set to improve your communities' and residents' safety, and that the policy is substantial, legitimate, and has no discriminatory interest.</p><p><strong>Remove blanket/generalized felony bans.</strong> Check whether your policy includes any ""blanket"" exclusions for <em>all</em> convictions or <em>all</em> felonies. Those policies are likely to be challenged by disparate impact claims.</p><p><strong>Determine most serious and violent crimes</strong>. Replace any generalized felony or conviction bans with only the most serious or violent crimes that accomplish your goal of reducing risk. These may include both felony and misdemeanor crimes as long as consideration has been given to the nature of the crime.</p><p><strong>Include look-back periods and exit from incarceration.</strong> Keep recidivism rates in mind when setting look-back periods. Look-back periods may be based on the conviction date or the date of exit from incarceration.</p><p><strong>Address applicants with multiple unrelated violent and nonviolent felony convictions</strong>. A pattern of criminal activity may present a risk to your community (especially if it's recent), so you may want to consider the number of criminal events within a period of time. The events may be unrelated, but a pattern of crimes may show a propensity toward risky behaviors over a short period of time or within a recent period of time.</p><p><strong>Remember the FCRA.</strong> Add language that informs applicants that when criminal records are found, they may have an opportunity to appeal and provide circumstances surrounding the criminal events.</p><p>As you review your policies and make adjustments, keep in the back of your mind the goal you have-to demonstrate that your policies are set to improve your community's and resident's safety, and that the policy is substantial, legitimate, and has no discriminatory interests, Richer says. You will also want to consider if there is any less discriminatory practice that could achieve the same goal.</p><p>And don't forget, your policies may come under scrutiny from testers, she warned. Take the time to train your staff properly, and for them to properly communicate your policy regarding criminal records. You want to be sure your policy isn'tbeing communicated in an abbreviated fashion, and that your staffers aren'tdiscouraging applicants with criminal histories from applying to your communities.</p><p><strong>Appeals of Rejections/Individualized Assessments</strong></p><p>In addition to developing a complex policy that includes a graduated tier of look-back periods that relate to the seriousness of the crimes, Williams said that another way to defend your criminal history policy is to include in the policy a description of an applicant's right to appeal a rejection.</p><p>Each rejection should inform the applicant that she has a right to obtain a copy of the criminal record on which the rejection is based. If you use a third-party screening company, these records should be provided by your screening company.</p><p>Decide who in your company will conduct these appeals, Williams suggested. It often proves useful to assign appeals to the same person or persons so they can develop some expertise in how to conduct these hearings, including the factors that prove to be the strongest to indicate a rejection should be maintained or reversed.  </p><p>Williams often uses the term ""individualized assessment"" when reviewing whether an applicant is able to explain mitigating circumstances that may change the original determination to reject an application due to a criminal record. There are a number of factors that can be considered during the appeal, including:</p><ul>	<li>The seriousness of the criminal offense;</li>	<li>The relationship between the criminal offense and the safety and security of residents, staff, or property;</li>	<li>The length of time since the offense, with particular weight being given to significant periods of good behavior;</li>	<li>The age of the household member at the time of the offense;</li>	<li>The number and nature of any other criminal convictions; and</li>	<li>Evidence of rehabilitation.</li></ul><p>If you are holding an apartment, this process obviously needs to be completed as soon as possible, so it's a good idea to put time limits on all aspects of an appeal, Williams said. In conventional housing, if it is going to take more than a week or two for the hearing and decision to occur, Williams said it makes sense to move forward with leasing the apartment to another applicant. In federally funded housing, the result may be different due to HUD's appeal requirements.</p><p>There has not been a defined time frame by HUD, so Richer said it will depend on your housing availability and the length of the waiting list. In some cases, it may make sense to hold the apartment for a few days. If the time period expires, the apartment becomes available to another qualified applicant. You could set a reasonable time frame for the applicant to provide the necessary information for your appeal and provide him with the ""next available"" apartment in the event that the initial time frame expired.</p><p>During the presentation, Williams was asked whether this process was taking the housing industry back to a subjective review of the applicant. Those concerns were legitimate, she said. The federal government is asking housing providers to consider whether their criminal history policies reflect a genuine concern for safety or are merely based on generalized stereotypes of the dangers posed by ex-offenders.</p><p>While the country works to address difficult problems with the criminal justice system, Williams said that housing providers are tasked to treat applicants with criminal records somewhat similarly to residents who request reasonable accommodations. As you know, these are decided on a case-by-case basis, and companies are developing employees with expertise to make these decisions. Due to the seriousness of this issue, Williams suggested that housing providers devote a similar commitment to administering criminal history screening policies and give applicants an opportunity to explain their individual situations.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1533,23,1,1560781451,1560781451,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12919,"<p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status."" In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class. This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement. This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p>",959,994,1580,16019,column,und,Revisiting Rules and Regulations in All-Age Communities: Unenforceable Rules Trumped by Familial Status Rights,"<h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination. Familial status is defined as ""one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity. Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification. What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms? A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs. This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation: the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success. Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances. In other words, each case is a test-case. In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following.

The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted.

These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning – No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol> <li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li> <li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li> <li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li> <li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine – in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li> <li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service – disseminating information and facts – not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five.

Hot Tub Temperatures – CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa. High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning. In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death.

Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe. Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission. Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from traffic–related pedestrian death and injury.

Most children were under the age of five. Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly. The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious. Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes. Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it. Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""

The fact that the tenants pay a <em>pro rata</em> portion of the cost in their base rent does not give them any ownership rights in the amenities paid for.

However, I can see a contrary argument, that since the cost recovery was never made part of a ""special assessment plan,"" you're too late for that too.

There is still a big gap between what should happen after such claims and what actually does happen.</p><p>            The following is a brief overview of federal and state law as it pertains to sexual harassment claims that can be brought by employees, independent contractors, vendors, and members of the public against MHC owners and managers.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16480,column,und,SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS IN THE WORKPLACE: WHAT MHC OWNERS AND MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW,"<p align=""center""><strong><u>The Law and Sexual Harassment</u></strong></p><p>            Sexual harassment in the work place is a form of illegal sex discrimination and is absolutely prohibited by both state and federal law.  It has become the most common form of work place harassment.  Any unwelcome sexual advance in the work place, either verbal or physical, is considered sexual harassment.</p><p>            Any such advance or conduct by an employee, independent contractor or vendor may be unlawful if it affects an individual's employment, interferes with that employee's work performance or creates an intimidating or hostile work environment. California and numerous other states have expanded the scope of sexual harassment to include pregnancy and gender identity issues.</p><p>            Federal and state law recognize that sexual harassment in the work place often produces in employees feeling of anger, frustration, shame, depression and in more extreme cases, post-traumatic stress disorder.  As an MHC owner or manager you should know that the law governs all work place relationships.  In addition to employees, it covers the relationship between your employees, independent contractors, vendors, outside co-workers, supervisors and your park residents.</p><p>            Both an employee who is accused of sexual harassment and the employer who is responsible for that employee's supervision may be liable for damages to the victim.  Of particular importance is that fact that an employer may be held strictly liable where a supervisor is accused of harassment even when the employer was unaware of the harassment.</p><p>            The damages that may be recovered by an employee against another harassing employee or the employer include:</p><ol>	<li>The recovery of back wages and benefits;</li>	<li>The recovery of litigation fees and costs;</li>	<li>Order requiring the rehire of the employee; and</li>	<li>The recovery of damages for emotional distress and lost reputation.  In certain states unlimited compensatory and punitive damages are also allowed and the employer may be ordered to undergo specific sexual harassment training.</li></ol><p align=""center""><strong><u>What is Sexual Harassment?</u></strong></p><p>            There are two basic types of sexual harassment:  Quid pro quo (an instance where a supervisor conditions a job benefit on sexual activity); or hostile work environment (where there is a pervasive environment of harassment or innuendo that interferes with an employee's performance).  The law recognizes that a single incident of sexual harassment, if severe, can constitute sexual harassment in the work place.  Of course, a series of less severe incidents occurring in the work place, when taken together, may constitute sexual harassment as well.  The key to determining whether or not conduct rises to this level is to determine whether or not the conduct negatively alters the employee's work environment in a material way.  These determinations will be evaluated against a ""reasonable person standard"".  A judge or jury deciding such a case would typically be asked to place a ""reasonable person"" in the shoes of the alleged victim for the purpose of evaluating whether or not a reasonable person would be injured in a similar way and to the same degree as claimed by the alleged victim.</p><p>            Sexual harassment can be found in various forms of speech, including routine conversation, the giving of compliments, innuendo, off-color jokes and embarrassing personal inquiries.  The common thread is that this speech is sexual in nature and unacceptable to the victim.</p><p>            Generally, remarks constituting sexual innuendo are always inappropriate and therefore, illegal.  Jokes involving a person's sexuality, appearance, orientation, or bodily functions are also usually inappropriate and illegal.  It is entirely predictable that such jokes will be offensive to one or more employees who may be listening and therefore unreasonably interfere with their working environment.  Remarks of a personal nature including an employee's sex life, sexual preference, history, etc. are also off-limits and should be avoided in every instance.</p><p>            Sexual harassment constituting quid pro quo amounts to illegal sexual favoritism.  An employee who is offered benefits in exchange for sexual favors; denied benefits for the refusal to exchange sexual favors; and assignment and compensation benefits in exchange for sexual favors are all illegal sex discrimination.</p><p>            Non-verbal harassment can also constitute illegal work place activity on the part of the employer.  Examples of this type of behavior include staring, leering, sexually oriented hand gestures, invading personal space, facial expressions and personal gifts of a sexual nature.  Of course, unsolicited or unwelcome physical contact of a sexual nature is categorically prohibited.  This type of behavior includes any unwelcome touching, blocking, or hazing.</p><p>            It is important for MHC owners and managers to be aware of the fact that they may not allow displays of sexually provocative material to exist in their work places.  This includes the display of such posters, signs, cartoons or pictures in the work place.  Unwanted personal letters, sexually oriented emails or texts are also illegal and may form a sound basis for a sexual harassment claim. </p><p align=""center""><strong><u>Investigating a Claim</u></strong></p><p>As a MHC manager, you may be supervising multiple employees, independent contractors and vendors on a day-to-day basis.  You may be the first person to receive a complaint.  You may be in a position to respond constructively to such a complaint and potentially keep your company and the owner of the park free from liability.  As a park manager, you should always contact your immediate supervisor and the park owner so that they are aware of the alleged conduct and the steps being taken to address and resolve the claim.  It may be advisable to retain the services of a law firm specializing in employment law at an early juncture to initiate and coordinate the investigation of a sexual harassment claim in the work place.  In this way, much of the investigation can be managed at a professional arms-length, while ensuring that much of the information received remains confidential and protected from later discovery in the event of litigation.</p><p>            In the event that an employee makes a claim of sexual harassment in your work place, it is very important that the employer (or a law firm on your behalf) take immediate steps to investigate the claim and prevent any further harassment from taking place.  Those steps are as follows:</p><ol>	<li>Separately interview the victim and the accused.  These interviews should be recorded (with the participants' knowledge) or reduced to writing and reviewed and acknowledged by the interviewee;</li>	<li>The employee should pursue other avenues of investigation to determine the facts, including discreet one-on-one interviews with other potential witnesses, review of physical evidence, including correspondence, email's, pictures, etc. and assemble all in the investigative file;</li>	<li>Once the employer is reasonably sure about the facts, appropriate and immediate steps should be taken to stop the conduct to ensure that it does not continue;</li>	<li>The employer should schedule periodic follow-up meetings with the victim and document the results of that follow-up meeting to ensure that the employer's remedial steps are working; and</li>	<li>Ensure that there is no retaliation of any kind against the victimized employee.</li></ol><p>A MHC owner or manager should take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of each individual involved in the investigation.  Information about the investigation should only be shared with whom it's necessary to investigate and resolve the claim.  You cannot promise complete confidentiality because it may be necessary to share certain information with others to gain a complete understanding of the events leading up to the claim.  Only those who absolutely need to know within the company should be involved.

Hylton. This is a rental case but the ruling holds several important legal lessons for any housing provider.</p><p>The complaint alleged that the Hyltons, a Black married couple, violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by refusing to allow a mixed-race couple, the Bilbos, to sublet their unit to a Black woman with children because they did not want ""too many Blacks"" at the property.</p>",959,994,1580,16021,column,und,Submeter Your Community at Zero Out of Pocket Landlord Expense,"<p>The decision awarded the following damages:<br />- $31,750 to Mr. And Mrs. Bilbo because their landlord made discriminatory statements to them about being a mixed-race couple, and about the race of their prospective subtenant refusing to allow them to sublet the home to an African American woman and her children because of race.<br />o $10K of this sum was awarded for emotional distress.<br />- Because Ms. Wilson, the prospective subtenant, was denied the home she sought and was qualified for, she continued to live in a racially concentrated area of poverty. Her damages were awarded at $44,431.05<br />o As part her damages, the court awarded Ms. Wilson $20K for compensation for the lost opportunity to live in a neighborhood of lower crime, higher educational opportunities, and greater upward mobility.<br />- Nearly half of the judgment, before attorneys' fees, was for punitive damages.<br />- An additional $37,422 in attorneys' fees brings the total judgment against the defendants to over $113K.<br />Details of the case can be found online.<br />- A summary of the case is available on the HUD site: <a href=""http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-198"">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advi...</a>.<br />- A summary of the ruling is posted on the DOJ's site: <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/usao/ct/Press2013/20130812.html"">http://www.justice.gov/usao/ct/Press2013/20130812.html</a> (DOJ).<br />- The court's decision can be read at <a href=""http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:2011cv01543/94677/23"">http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:...</a></p><p>The Hyltons were independent rental owners managing their own property. They initially rented to the Bilbos; however, the Bilbos found that their personal circumstances required them to move and to break the lease agreement. The Bilbos agreed to find a suitable renter to sublease to. When they did the defendant asked if the person is white. When told she was Black, Hylton stated that he ""did not want too many Blacks at the property"" and that ""the neighbors would not want to see too many Blacks there."" The defendant also told the Bilbos the only reason they were rented the house was because his wife is white and it was ""a good mix.""</p><p>There are several salient points in this case, none of them new but none-the-less noteworthy.</p><p>MRS. MURPHY'S EXEMPTION<br />First, the housing providers in this case were 'mom and pop' landlords representing themselves. Their blatant disregard for the law and others' civil rights is clear from the case but the harm they caused - to the complainants and to their own pocketbook - may have been avoided with fair housing education and / or by hiring a professional manager who's practice it was to know and abide by all federal, state, and local laws.</p><p>As their defense, the defendants argued they were not subject to the Fair Housing Act given what is commonly referred to as the 'Mrs. Murphy's Exemption'twhich states:<br />Any single-family house sold or rented by an owner provided that such private individual does not own more than three such single-family homes at anyone time...  if such house is sold or rented (A) without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesman, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings...  and (B) without the publication, posting or mailing, after notice of any advertisement or written notice in violation of [the FHA].<br />Put plainly, small, independent landlords can discriminate based on protected class only if they do not hire a professional (thereby enjoining someone else in the act of discrimination) and if they do not 'advertise' a discriminatory preference. Here, 'advertising' means, essentially, any outward expression ranging from verbal or written statements (ads whether printed or online, flyers, etc.). Interestingly, in this case the property in question was held by Hylton Real Estate Management, which only Mrs. Hylton had an ownership interest in. Because her husband, Mr. Hylton did not have an ownership interest in the company that owned the property only she, not he, qualified for this exemption. Mrs. Hylton argued that the Mr. acted as her husband and not as 'someone in the business of renting dwellings' in dealing with the Bilbos. However, Mr. Hylton himself stipulated that he was in the business of renting dwellings and detailed the tasks he performs in such capacity and, indeed, his behavior substantiated this. All of that aside, his outward expression, or 'publication'tof a discriminatory intent trumped the Mrs. Murphy's Exemption binding him to the full responsibilities of the FHA, even if he had had an ownership interest in the property.</p><p>It should be clearly noted here that Oregon state law provides greater protection than federal and does not allow for the Mrs. Murphy's Exemption. Essentially, all housing providers must comply with federal, state, and local fair housing laws in Oregon.</p><p>VICARIOUS LIABILITY<br />Secondly, this case reaffirms what preexisting case law has already established in terms of vicarious liability. As stated in the court's decision, ""Although Mr. Hylton is the individual who directly discriminated against Ms. Wilson and the Bilbos, both Mrs. Hylton and [the company] may be held vicariously liable for this discriminatory actions."" ... 'It is clear under the FHA, owners of real estate may be held vicariously liable for discriminatory acts by their agents and employees.' Glover v. Jones Therefore, if Mr. Hylton was acting as Mrs. Hylton's agent, Mrs. Hylton, as sole owner of [the property] is also liable for his discriminatory actions. See Cabrera v. Jakabovitz""</p><p>DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS<br />Here, the court said it best in its decision: ""Third, as to the request for damages for emotional distress, 'it is axiomatic that civil rights plaintiffs may recover compensatory damages for emotional distress.' Ragin It is not necessary for a plaintiff to provide evidence of treatment by a healthcare professional or use of medication to be entitled to damages for emotional distress. See Parris v. Pappas...  (distinguishing ""significant"" and ""egregious"" claims for emotional distress from ""garden variety"" claims... ). In the context of Fair Housing Act violations, courts have 'recognized the severe mental trauma associated with unlawful discrimination and have upheld large compensatory awards for the victims in such cases.' Broome v. Biondi 'The key factors in determining emotional distress damages are the complainant's reaction to the discriminatory conduct and the egregiousness of the respondent's behavior.' HUD v. Walker When claims have been categorized as ""garden variety"" - meaning the claim for distress is devoid of evidence of medical treatment or physical manifestation - the amount of damages authorized ranges from $5,000 to $125,000. Parris""</p><p>PUNITIVE DAMAGES<br />As stated above, the judge found in this case that the defendant acted with evil motive and showed no remorse justifying an award of punitive damages amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>LOST HOUSING OPPORTUNITY DAMAGES<br />Finally, the issue of lost housing opportunity damages is also interesting. Here the court found that Ms. Wilson suffered based on key testimony from an expert in the field of ""neighborhood effects."" The court concluded that there were ""vast differences between the neighborhoods"" in which she sought to leave and that which the subject property was located in amounting to ""fewer 'life chances'.""</p><p>It's clearly not only important to be familiar with the federal FHA, but to know applicable state, local, and case law, as well. Issues such as vicarious liability, and what kinds of damages may be awarded, as well as other legal precedents such as disparate impact, what constitutes illegally discriminatory advertising, etc., should all be relevant to housing providers both at the company or organizational level and at the individual level. As this case illustrates, the owner was personally liable for her agent's actions, even though she did not directly violate the law. This is true for 'rank and file' staff / employees / contractors as well, not just owners - that is, if a maintenance tech. or leasing agent violates the law, not only is the company and property owner liable, that individual may personally be sued as well.</p><p>It is important to follow fair housing case law and to commit to a regular educational routine for yourself and all who work with you.

Health professionals are increasingly touting the benefits of a good night's sleep for optimal health. Are you sleeping like a baby, secure in the knowledge that your company has carefully analyzed the overtime status of its employees under Oregon law and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA"")?  Or are you tossing and turning, concerned that with every paycheck issued, your company may be exposing itself to liability for unpaid overtime, penalties and damages, and attorneys' fees?  If so, keep reading, and you'll be sleeping through the night in no time.</p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16318,column,und,Sweet Dreams: don't Let Overtime Exemption Issues Become Nightmares,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>            The FLSA generally requires employers to pay a minimum wage (currently $7.50 an hour) for all hours worked, as well as overtime pay at time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek.  Oregon law imposes similar, but not identical, requirements.  Effective July 1, 2016, depending on where your employees work, the Oregon minimum wage currently ranges from $9.50 to $9.75 per hour.  The minimum will increase annually and will eventually reach a maximum range of $12.50 to $14.75 an hour, with subsequent increases based on increases to the Consumer Price Index. </p><p>            In addition to establishing a minimum wage, Oregon law and the FLSA also require covered employers to pay overtime wages at time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.  Like the minimum wage requirements, the overtime rules apply unless the employee is ""exempt""; non-exempt employees are subject to the overtime rules and must be paid accordingly for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek.</p><br><p><strong>Who's Exempt?</strong></p><p>            Both Oregon law and the FLSA provide certain exemptions from the overtime requirements.  Most common are the so-called ""white collar"" exemptions: the executive, administrative, and professional exemptions.  The white collar exemptions are not identical under Oregon law and the FLSA, but they are similar.  To be exempt under one of the white collar exemptions, an employee must satisfy a duties test,  a salary threshold test, and a salary basis test.</p><p>            The ""salary basis"" test requires that exempt employees be paid a fixed amount per pay period, and the amount is not subject to variance due to the quality or quantity of work produced.  While both Oregon and federal law provide a limited number of specific exceptions, employers generally may not make deductions from an exempt employee's salary without putting the overtime exemption at risk.  Ordinarily, except for permissible deductions, or additions such as bonuses or commissions, one would expect to see an identical amount of gross wages on an exempt employee's pay check from pay period to pay period.</p><p>            The ""salary threshold"" test imposes a minimum salary requirement.  Under Oregon law, the minimum salary is simply 40 times the minimum wage.  Since 2004, the FLSA minimum salary has been $455 per week ($23,660 annually).  However, that number is about to increase-substantially. Effective December 1, 2016, the minimum salary for an exempt ""white collar"" employee will be $913 a week ($47,476 annually).  Regardless of their duties, ""white collar"" employees generally will be non-exempt if they earn less than $913 per week.</p><p>            In determining whether an employee satisfies the minimum salary after December 1, 2016, the FLSA will allow employers to count non-discretionary bonuses and ""catch up"" payments once a quarter.  However, the salary threshold must be paid ""exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities.""  Consequently, the cost or market value of housing provided to a manager may not count toward the $913 weekly minimum salary.</p><p>            If an employee satisfies the ""salary basis"" and ""salary threshold"" tests, then the employee will be exempt from FLSA and Oregon overtime if the employee also meets the duties test for the particular ""white collar"" exemption at issue, whether it is the executive, administrative, or professional exemption.  While an examination of the duties test is beyond the scope of the article, employers should remain mindful of a couple of points with respect to overtime exemptions.  First, overtime exemptions are narrowly construed in favor of employees.  Along the same lines, an employer always has the burden of proof when it comes to proving that a particular employee meets the salary and duties tests sufficient to qualify as exempt.  Finally, while a good job description is useful, the employee's actual day-to-day duties will determine whether an overtime exemption applies.</p><br><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>Because of the litigation risks, employers confronted with close exemption situations simply may elect to treat the employee as non-exempt and pay overtime for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.  It may also make sense in close cases to require the employees to record their hours to avoid inflated claims in litigation.  In any event, employers should always thoroughly evaluate the employees they treat as exempt; be in a position to prove that an overtime exemption applies; and do not forget about the increased salary threshold requirements effective December 1, 2016.

Unfortunately there are more than just the 10 items listed in this article. However, these 10 are an excellent start, and knowing about fair housing will help lead to understanding what should and should not be done when renting property. Understanding fair housing is the best protection against a claim that a fair housing law has been violated. If you are an attorney advising a landlord on what to watch out for, the following items are a good start.</p><br>",959,994,1580,16546,column,und,Ten Things Every Landlord Should Know About Fair Housing,"<p>1. ADVERTISING. Advertising is one of the most common ways landlords find people to place in rental properties. When advertising, landlord clients should describe property attributes and/or amenities, not what they are or are not looking for in a resident. Landlords should not say ""great for a young couple"" as it may be considered discriminatory to families with children. Nor should landlords say ""safe"" or ""exclusive"" as this may imply they only rent to certain groups. At the end of the advertisement, landlords should use either the fair housing logo or a disclaimer such as ""This community does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or familial status."" Photographs need to be carefully considered before use in advertising and only after speaking with an attorney.</p><p>2. STEERING. ""Steering"" occurs when a landlord attempts to direct a resident, for whatever reason, to a specific area of the property. To help avoid claims of ""steering"" by a prospective resident, landlords should show all available properties to prospects, let the prospect decide what to see and what to skip, and finally present only facts about the property and the community, not about other residents or neighbors. Landlords should never say ""you would really like this particular apartment because it is nice and quiet with few children around"", or ""there are lots of other children in the same age group as your own"" as both statements may be considered a violation of fair housing law. Failing to show a handicapped person the recreational areas (on the assumption the prospect would not use those facilities) may create potential liability. However, if a prospective resident expressly states they are not interested in seeing a specific area it is okay to skip that area. Even if asked, landlords should never comment on the ""types"" of persons who live in the community.</p><p>3. SCREENING/APPLICATIONS. Fair housing claims arise frequently as a result of the application and screening process. Landlords should have a written rental policy detailing the criteria necessary for approval to live in their property. The rental policy should include occupancy guidelines, availability policy, rental criteria (i.e. employment history/income, credit standards, etc.) with an explanation of what the criteria are, an outline of the application process and that your client adheres to all applicable fair housing laws. Questions included on the application should not ask about physical or mental disabilities, and landlords should limit questions about drug/alcohol use and lawsuits. Asking questions regarding prior evictions, prior money judgments, bankruptcy and why prospective residents are leaving their current landlord are acceptable and may provide important information. Once a written policy is created, the landlord should expect strict adherence and compliance with the written policy. Additionally, landlords need to keep good records of each applicant or inquiry. However, if an applicant requests a deviation from the written policy based on a disability, the landlord should consult you immediately before making a decision.</p><p>4. OCCUPANCY STANDARDS. In 1996 Congress enacted a law based upon a 1991 HUD memo stating that a 2-person-per-bedroom occupancy standard was acceptable in most situations. This is by no means a hard and fast rule with regard to the number of occupants for a particular residence. This figure can change depending on how the property is laid out. More occupants may be allowed if there are unusually large living spaces or bedrooms, and fewer occupants if the opposite holds true. Many fair housing experts believe that infants do not count when calculating occupancy standards.</p><p>5. APARTMENT RULES. It is absolutely acceptable for a landlord to have a set of ""house rules"" for all residents to live by. The house rules should be basic and non-discriminatory. Rules should be written so they are applicable to all residents and not just specific groups of residents. Rules stating ""Children shall not roughhouse in the hallway"" may be discriminatory. Using general terms such as ""Residents or guests"" should keep the rule unbiased, fair and applicable to all residents. Rules must be enforced uniformly against all residents and records regarding rule violations need to be kept. The records should include the time/date and manner of the violation, how the landlord became aware of the violation and what actions were taken to enforce the rule. As a special note, pool rules should be carefully scrutinized to insure they do not discriminate against children. A rule saying ""no children under 4 in the pool area"" is discriminatory, while a rule saying ""children under 12 must be supervised by an adult over 18"" is likely not discriminatory. As always, landlords should consult you for specific state or local laws on these issues as well.</p><p>6. REASONABLE ACCOMODATION. A reasonable accommodation is at the resident's request and when a client voluntarily makes exceptions to their standard rules/policies to accommodate the resident's disability. The requested accommodation must be reasonable and should not present an undue burden on the landlord. If the accommodation is not reasonable or if it would impose an undue hardship on the landlord, the request may be denied. If the request is denied a letter should be sent to the resident explaining the denial, the facts behind the denial, how those facts were discovered and offering to meet with the resident. Landlords should not offer to make an accommodation to a resident but should wait for a resident to request the accommodation. Offering an accommodation before it is requested may subject your client to a claim of discrimination.</p><p>7. REASONABLE MODIFICATION. This should not be confused with a reasonable accommodation. Landlords may require a resident to pay for modifications to the property and require that those modifications be removed when the resident vacates the property. If the modification were for something that federal law already requires a landlord to have in place then the landlord would be responsible for the cost of the modifications. Landlords should check with you to determine where financial responsibility for common-area modifications lay, and whether the resident would be responsible for both the installation and removal of the modifications. As with accommodations, the modifications must be reasonable.</p><p>8. RECORD KEEPING. Landlords need to keep records on all prospective residents, in addition to current/past residents. Landlords can create a system of guest cards or logs with relevant information (i.e. date/time of visit, properties shown, prospective move-in date, etc.) as well as a log of all calls made by prospective residents, even if the resident never comes to see the property. Records regarding available properties also need to be kept and updated every time there is a change in availability. Additionally, all applications should be retained, even if the applications were rejected or withdrawn. Landlords should contact you regarding how long the records should be saved in order to comply with changing requirements in federal and state law, as well as what types of records to maintain. Being able to produce consistent records showing nondiscriminatory application of written screening criteria in every case can usually successfully defend a Fair Housing claim.</p><p>9. EMPLOYEE TRAINING. Landlords need to ensure that there is a written policy to avoid claims for harassment, particularly sexual harassment. Every time a new employee joins the staff there should be a training meeting about fair housing laws and how to comply with them. The meeting should include copies of all memos regarding policies about how to comply with fair housing, what can happen to the landlord for a violation and what will happen to the employee who violates fair housing.</p><p>10. EVICTION. Landlords should not be afraid to evict a resident for legitimate reasons because of a fear of a fair housing violation claim. The rules set by the landlord apply to all residents equally. When contemplating an eviction for other than non-payment of rent advise your client to ask themselves the following two questions: (1) Has there been a serious violation of the lease agreement? (2) Do you and have you evicted other residents for the same type of problems or behavior? If the answer to these questions is yes, then an eviction would be warranted under the circumstances. Resident files should contain records of all complaints against the resident and what has been done in response to each of the complaints. HUD has historically looked for five types of documentation when dealing with fair housing claims. Landlords should document and include in resident files the following information: (1) warning letters/eviction notices, (2) written complaints by third parties, (3) written logs kept by management, (4) police records and (5) photographs. Resident file documentation needs to be consistent for all residents. This documentation may prove there was a legitimate reason, unrelated to any fair housing claims, for evicting the resident.</p><p>All information contained in this article is consistent with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C.A. 3601 <em>et seq</em>.)

All ashes, garbage, rubbish and other waste must be disposed of in a clean, safe and legal manner.

Both the tenant and other persons in the home or on the space must behave in compliance with any laws or ordinances that relate to the tenant's behavior as a tenant.</li>	<li><u>Use of the Space and Common Areas</u>.   The tenant may not misuse or unreasonably use the space or common areas, taking into consideration the purposes for which they were designed and intended. </li>	<li><u>Debris</u>. The tenant must keep the rented space in every part free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin as the condition of the rented space permits and to the extent that the tenant is responsible for causing the problem. The tenant must reasonably cooperate in assisting the landlord in any reasonable effort to remedy the problem.

The tenant is required to behave, and require his or her guests to behave in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors. This is an all-too-frequently overlooked provision of the law.  Many times a tenant's offending conduct, while not specifically prohibited in the park documents, is nevertheless bothering to other tenants.  Landlords would be well-advised to remember this provision of ORS 90.740 in those difficult cases in which the activities, such as voyeurism or stalking, cause undue concern to the neighbors. </li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">What happens if the tenant violates any of these statutory provisions?  Is there a remedy?  Assuming that the tenant will not comply with the landlord's requests for voluntary compliance, and there are no other reasonable alternatives, enforcement action is available in the same manner as a violation of the rental agreement or rules, i.e. issuance of a 30-day notice of termination.  Under ORS 90.630, this means that the landlord must issue a written notice to the tenant advising that the tenancy will terminate in 30 days if the violation is not cured.  The law provides that a second violation occurring within six months of the date of the preceding 30-day notice will entitle the landlord to issue a written non-curable notice terminating the tenancy in 20 days.  As with all such notices, members are advised to use the MHCO forms, making sure that they are complete in all respects before delivering or mailing them to the tenant.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1533,23,1,1479825689,1512941618,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13540,"<p>HUD recently announced it's charging a Texas property owner and management company with discriminating against families with children.

To the contrary, the resident claimed that the neighbor was allowed to stay in his unit until his lease expired and he moved out in January 2013.

Aside from ensuring that your policies and procedures conform to fair housing law, you can reduce the likelihood of a complaint by properly training and supervising all employees-not only managers and leasing staff, but also maintenance workers and anyone else who interacts with the public.

The difference is that the month-to-month agreement runs for the number of days in the current month.  In the absence of termination by landlord or tenant, the periodic tenancy just ""rolls over"" month to month.  Regardless of which agreement is used, landlords renting or leasing spaces to residents in mobile home parks may not terminate them without cause.  However, a lease for at least two years carries a distinct advantage in that the park documents, i.e. the lease agreement and the park rules, may be <em>automatically</em> updated at the end of each lease term.  While there are certain limitations on the landlord's right to impose new park documents on the resident, it is clearly much easier to do under a lease than a monthly rental agreement.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>  Also, landlords using a fixed terms lease agreement must expressly incorporate any rent increase provisions into the written agreement.  The rent increase statute, ORS 90.600, applies <em>only</em> to periodic (e.g. month-to-month) tenancies and not fixed term tenancies.  If the home located upon the space is a recreational vehicle rather than a manufactured home, landlords should <em>not</em> use the standard mobile home space rental agreement.  The reason is that the mobile home park section of the landlord-tenant law does not apply to recreational vehicles.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>  When renting space for a recreational vehicle, landlords should use an appropriate MHCO RV rental form.</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.25in;""> </p><ol>	<li value=""2"">Make sure that the rental agreement is signed by <em>all</em> adult tenants who will occupy the space.

Trying to get signatures after-the-fact can be difficult, if not impossible.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""3"">Make sure that the Statement of Policy, Rules, and Rental Agreement are given to the resident and properly receipted for.  Occasionally, residents deny receiving one or more of these documents.  However, the signed receipt by the resident is legal evidence of delivery of these documents.  ORS 90.510(9) provides that a signed receipt is a defense to a claim against the landlord for the failure to deliver these documents.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""4"">Similarly, landlords should make sure that the rights they summarize in the Statement of Policy accurately reflect their rental agreement and rules.  When using the MHCO forms this is not a problem.  It could be, however, when different forms from different sources are used, and the Statement of Policy provides that the resident has (or does not have) certain rights that are inconsistent with the terms found in the rental agreement or rules. The Statement of Policy is not intended to be a binding legal document - it is supposed to merely summarize the resident's rights and duties that are found in the rental agreement or rules.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""5"">Landlords should be sure to fully understand their rights and responsibilities given under their rental agreement form.

Landlords should make sure that when a resident vacates, leaving a guest or visitor at the space, immediate action is taken to either terminate the tenancy or require that the occupant promptly apply for tenancy by filling out all required documentation.  Do not accept rent from the occupant, the ex-tenant, or on the occupant's behalf, until the issue has been thoroughly resolved.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""7"">Be aware that the fire insurance provision in the MHCO form does <em>not</em> apply unless it is specifically checked:  It requires that the resident must maintain a homeowner's policy of insurance that includes coverage for fire in an amount sufficient to replace the home, and permits the landlord to request a current copy of the policy.</li></ol><br><ol>	<li value=""8"">Similarly, landlords should be sure to have the resident initial those portions of the rental agreement which require them to do so.  There are several such places found in the sections dealing with (a) sale of the home and (b) the resident's legal obligations under the tenancy.  When these sections are not properly initialed, there remains an argument that it is not binding.

INTRODUCTION: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT LENDING CLIMATE FOR MHP'S</p><p>Everyone knows that interest rates in re- cent years -- in the wake of the financial melt- down that occurred in the mid-2008 to mid-2009 timeframe -- have been at historic lows. While in the past few quarters of 2013 rates have crept up slightly, interest rates are still favorable from a historical perspective. Clearly, none of us have crystal balls as to how long rates will remain at these relatively attractive rates. So no guarantees on the duration of this favorable market for interest rates can be made.</p>",959,994,1580,16002,column,und,The Ten Worst Mistakes to Avoid in Community Management,"<p>Nevertheless, if you either own a mobile home park (""MHP"") and you're considering a refinance, or you are contemplating acquiring one, at least commercial lenders with savvy in the MHP arena appreciate the di- versification to their portfolios which having loans to MHP owners pro- vides.</p><p>This has been especially true in the wake of the crisis ensuing from the high default rate on Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities. Thus, while an oversimplification, the financial debacle of 2008-2009 was largely precipitated by many securitized loans going ""south"" due to credit being overextended primarily on residential mortgages.</p><p>In contrast, MHP's are viewed by lenders as attractive to finance precisely because housing opportunities that MHP's offer are monetarily more feasible for many for whom single family homes are economically out of reach. Because MHP's also comprise a different kind of housing than condominiums, apartments, or single-family homes, and are available to various income levels, they inherently provide a level of diversification for Lenders' portfolios.</p><p>With this as introduction to the current lender climate vis-íÊ-vis pro- viding loans with MHP's as collateral, we turn now to address a particular quirk specific to such loans.</p><p>II. BORROWING ENTITY</p><p>One unique issue that arises in the context of loans secured by a MHP is that frequently a MHP owner also owns, or perhaps through foreclosure acquires, mobile homes located on various spaces throughout the park.</p><p>If these homes are titled in the borrowing entity, then these homes will end up as collateral for the loan, in addition to the MHP itself, including all amenities (usually at least one clubhouse and a pool area) located at the park.</p><p>We recommend that an entity separate and apart from the Borrower should be established to take title to such homes. While there are in- evitable expenses to set up and maintain another entity, such costs are trivial in light of the potential liability exposure and/or hassles entailed in having title to both mobile homes and the park itself being vested in the same borrowing entity.</p><p>The primary concern as to liability exposure is illustrated by a thankfully rare example that occurred within the last few years in Texas. Tragically, a park-owned home caught fire, burned down, and an occupant of the home died in the blaze. In our unfortunately litigious society, where plaintiff's attorneys target deep pockets, this scenario creates the possibility whereby all assets of the Borrower could be at risk. With a single entity owning both the MHP and homes, the ""pockets"" of the owner of the mobile home run as deep as the pockets of the park owner, since in this scenario these pockets are one and the same.</p><p>There are also hassles entailed in having the same borrowing entity hold title to the park as holds title to homes located at the park. A prime ex- ample of such hassles pertains to the limits on the Borrower/Owner's flexibility in dealing with their park-owned homes. Because these homes will be additional collateral for any loan to the Borrower/Owner, the homes will not be easily saleable if the Owner wants to sell or otherwise dispose of them. Generally, these homes will be encumbered due to the UCC filings any commercial lender will insist on as part of standard lending practices.</p><p>Frankly, the liability exposure issue exists even for a park owner who eventually pays off their loan and owns their park and homes free and clear. Using one entity to own both the MHP and homes for rent at the park (along with the underlying spaces) inherently deepens the Owner's pockets in the eyes of any plaintiff's attorney representing a resident who is injured due to some claimed defect of the home itself. This assumes, of course, that the resident's attorney could demonstrate that, for in- stance the Owner had been negligent in creating or allowing some unsafe condition to exist.</p><p>If you were going to refinance a MHP that you already own, and you currently own some homes in the same entity that will be the refinancing entity, then during the loan negotiations is the time to raise the issue with the lender as to transferring those homes to another entity which will not be the borrowing entity, such that the homes will not become a part of the collateral in the refinance.</p><p>Our experience in negotiating this kind of ""carve out"" for the homes not to comprise part of the collateral has been very favorable. Frankly, most lenders experienced with making loans to MHP's prefer not to have mobile homes serve as part of their collateral, due to the increased liability exposure issues, discussed briefly above. This is contra the general principle that lenders want to have as much collateral as possible.</p><p>Another issue worth touching on in the parameters of this discussion on financing or refinancing MHP's is that, similarly to apartment complexes or shopping centers, the lender is going to want to evaluate the quality and condition of the infrastructure. This means that before even contacting a lender, you would be well served to realistically assess the condition of the existing amenities, whether repairs or refurbishing or upgrades should be undertaken, etc.</p><p>Clearly, any commercial lender is going to require certain reserve funds be set aside in order to accomplish routine maintenance, as well as deferred maintenance and periodic upgrading of the existing amenities. So it be- hooves a prospective borrower to realistically assess what is likely to be needed and/or required by a lender, and to budget for these items and perhaps undertake to perform some maintenance prior to undertaking a refinance. (With an acquisition, of course one would be negotiating with the seller to provide either funds to be withheld from the sales price, or to undertake certain repairs or upgrades prior to the acquisition being completed.)</p><p>III. CONCLUSION</p><p>While commercial interest rates have started creeping up, they are still relatively favorable from a historical perspective. Because of the diversification which MHP financing offers for lenders' portfolios (as well as for investors' holdings), acquisition loans or refinancing of MHP's are still far more readily available than they were a decade or more ago.</p><p>As discussed above, due care should be taken to have any homes at the park which the park owner intends to own (or that the park owner acquires through foreclosures) have title taken in a separate entity to avoid in- creasing the liability exposure for the park owner, as well as to facilitate an owner's right to more easily dispose of such homes, at their discretion.</p><p>Rachelle Menaker is a partner with Hart, King &amp; Coldren's transactional prac- tice group.

MHCO additionally has an application form which solicits this and other information from prospective tenants.</p><br><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms.  Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check that provides the necessary verification.  Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day period within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does <em>not</em> prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees.  Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted application if it is incomplete - and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned.  Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided bad information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><br><p>It is also important to note that Oregon law permits the  '_landlord and the prospective purchaser (to) agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.""  Thus, as noted on the MHCO Application form, there is a place for the landlord to insert a period longer than the statutory seven day period.  If the landlord suspects any delay, either on the applicant's part or his own part, a longer period should be inserted.  If the applicant rejects this extension, then the landlord can decide whether he wants to proceed to process the application at all.</p><br><p>Note: If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' advance notice of intent to sell as required in ORS 90.680(4) (a), the landlord's seven day response time is extended to 10 days.  But remember, in no instances does the landlord have to receipt and process an inaccurate or incomplete application.  It is better not to accept a defective application - or return it immediately upon finding that it is inaccurate or incomplete, than continuing to process it.</p><br><p>If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser the application the landlord <em>shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale</em>. It is important to remember that the terms of these park document given to the prospective tenant need not be the same as those in the existing (i.e. selling) tenant's documents.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p><br><p><strong><em>Park Documents. </em></strong></p><br><p>Landlords and managers should always remember that when they change one of the park documents, they may have to change others. This is because of two risks: (a) The failure to incorporate a change in the lease, say, into the Statement of Policy, and (b) An inconsistency between one or more of the park documents, such as the rental agreement and the rules.  Rules can generally be changed in the middle of a tenancy, but rental agreements cannot.  So landlords should remember to make sure their documents are all internally consistent.</p><br><br><br><br><p><strong><em>Fair Housing Laws.</em></strong></p><br><p>The state and federal fair housing laws are essentially - but not completely - the same.  Landlords and managers should familiarize themselves with any special ordinances found in their city or county laws.  However, Oregon law prohibits any form of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing when directed at the following protected classes:  '_race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income.""<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>  The easiest, best, and safest way to deal with the risk of a discrimination claim is to make all screening criteria facially neutral.  Do not have rules which - even unintentionally - could have a negative impact on a member of a protected class. </p><br><p>In Oregon, most claims of discrimination relate to familial status.  Examples range from managers encouraging families to purchase and reside in one particular area of the community (where there are more children), to making off-hand comments to applicants (e.g. ""there would be very few children for your kids to play with here"") that may be construed as indicating a desire not to rent to people with children.  For this reason, landlords and managers should strive to apply their screening criteria <em>neutrally</em> regardless of the applicant's membership in a protected class. </p><br><p>Additionally, caution should be exercised in answering questions over the phone, since federal and state ""testers"" have been known to test parks by making multiple phone calls asking various loaded questions, such as ""Is this a good place to raise my children?""  If the community is a family park, the best response to open-ended telephone inquiries is to tell the caller that it is a family park, open to all, and that they are welcome to come in and pick up an application for processing.</p><br><p>One of the biggest areas of concern for landlords and managers today involve issues of immigration status.  At the risk of minimizing the problem, there is one basic rule that landlords and managers should always remember when screening applicants.  While it is not a ""silver bullet,"" it should help avoid the vast majority of issues regarding immigration status.  <em>Never treat any single applicant differently from another.</em>  This means that landlords should not automatically ""suspect"" that certain persons are illegally in this country and then impose more rigorous screening criteria on them alone.  It is best not to ask about immigration status.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>  If the applicant passes the same screening criteria imposed upon others, and all of the information in their application checks out, you should accept the current applicant, regardless of whether you have suspicions about their immigration status. One of the frequently asked questions is whether a landlord may insist that applicants provide their social security number.  While this is not automatically illegal, <em>it can be when applied to some applicants and not others</em>.  Consistency is the name of the game.  Do not request verification in some cases and not others.  Do not accept some tenants who fail to provide the number, but accept others (who are not obviously immigrants) without also providing such proof.</p><br><p>Another area of concern is occupancy limits or extra occupancy charges.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>  This is somewhat of a grey area because Oregon law currently permits a two person per bedroom rule - assuming that it is expressly listed as part of the park's screening criteria and uniformly applied.  However, the problem is that federal law contains no specific occupancy limits.  This means that, in theory, one could be in compliance with state law, while violating federal law.  For example, if a family consisted of two adults and three children who owned a 2-bedroom home, a ""2-persons per bedroom"" requirement would mean that they could not move into the park.  But if the third child was an infant who slept in the parents' room, one may ask whether this standard is reasonable, even though it complies with Oregon law.  At the risk of violating federal law, which imposes no such occupancy limits, the better approach might be to avoid the ""slippery slope"" problem entirely, by not creating occupancy limits.<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> </p><br><p>Perhaps the most difficult of screening criteria issues is in the area of assistance animals.  Since handicap is a protected class, this means that if one could establish a legitimate need for an assistance animal they could not be prevented from having one - even though the park might have a one-pet policy and this might be their second pet.  This could be so even though the animal was not trained or certified in providing assistance.  MHCO has Form 15 that may be given to tenants applying for a ""reasonable accommodation"" which is the technical term used when an allegedly handicapped person requests relief from strict application of a rule that interferes with their handicapped. <a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a> As most landlords and managers know, the handicap protections can be severely stretched.  There are many reasons for this, including, among other things, the handicap may be allegedly psychological, and the tenant has nothing more than a note from a doctor - not a treating psychologist or psychiatrist.</p><br><p>The other difficult issue is that assistant animals are not technically ""pets"" and therefore are not subject to the requirement that the Pet Agreement be completed.  Ultimately it comes down to a rule of reason and proof.  Does it appear that the person requesting the accommodation is legitimately handicapped? Do they have a known history of the handicap - that is, has it ever come up before?  Does it appear that the claim of a handicap is new, and possibly raised as a pretext, say to circumvent a one-pet policy? </p><br><p>Ultimately, the issue comes down to public safety in the community.  For example, if the tenant wanted to have a pit bull (in violation of a dangerous breed prohibition) or a bull-mastiff (in violation of a size restriction), the landlord should ask which battle he or she wants to fight?  If the tenant isn't credible, has a history of skirting the rules on this or other issues, it might make sense to refuse and let them take the next step.  If they bring the animal into the park in light of the denial, you will have a choice; either do nothing or send out a notice of violation which would require removal of the animal.  The risk in allowing dangerous or oversized breed into the park is that it may harm someone, and then the landlord will have to defend a lawsuit for failing to enforce their own rules.  Additionally, in consenting, the precedent has been set, now permitting such animals based upon a tenant's assertion the need it for assistance.  Remember, ""reasonable accommodations"" need only be ""reasonable.""  Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><br><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><br><p><strong><em>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues</em></strong></p><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home - they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually <em>afford</em> to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid. </li></ul><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""> </p><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied.  Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information. </li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible.</li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</li></ul><br><ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">	<li>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a <u>current</u> FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is <em>less.</em></li></ul><br><p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p><br><p>Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> Rental Agreement MHCO Form 5A and Lease Agreement Form 5B.</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> Rental Application MHCO Form 1, and Application Screening Charge Notice and Receipt, MHCO Form 9.</p></div><div id=""ftn3""><p><a href=""#_ftnref3"" name=""_ftn3"" title="""">[3]</a> See, ORS 90.680(5)</p></div><div id=""ftn4""><p><a href=""#_ftnref4"" name=""_ftn4"" title="""">[4]</a> Source of income would refer to whether the applicant was receiving some form of state or federal assistance, or child support, for example.</p></div><div id=""ftn5""><p><a href=""#_ftnref5"" name=""_ftn5"" title="""">[5]</a> While compliance with the law seems like a reasonable area of inquiry, the problem is that managers and landlords don't ask this question of a family from England or Germany.

The first camp seeks out training with the belief that it is valuable and beneficial; not only for the employee, but the organization as well.  The second camp believes that training is a waste of time and resources and avoids it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the second camp seems to be in the majority.  While most Directors, Vice Presidents, and Regional Managers fall into the first group, they often work for a member of the second group.</p><p><strong><u>Costs <em>vs.</em> Benefits of Training</u></strong></p><p>Training costs are directly measurable.  For example, sending an employee through an association sponsored training program will incur tuition costs, possible travel, and time away from their site.  Let's not forget the employee's wages while attending the course.  And, perhaps overtime or additional work load burdens for the other employees. Having a trainer come to your organization will also incur costs.  The speaker will have a fee as well as material costs.  Bringing everyone together will cost mileage dollars and refreshments.  Not to mention closing the offices down for a few hours and the possibility of missing that cherished rental/sales opportunity.</p><p>There is no question that training can be expensive.  But with proper planning and budgeting, the cost can be reduced.  The real question to ask is ""<strong><em><u>What is the cost of liability if the team is NOT receiving training?""</u></em></strong></p><p>The benefits of training are easily measureable.  For example, I have numerous clients tell me that leases increased the same afternoon as a morning leasing session, or the closing ratios improve dramatically.  Customer complaints decrease after training, and employees tend to be more cautious about Fair Housing once they have proper understanding of the laws and guidelines.  The right training can increase an employee's motivation and enthusiasm. Continued, regular training will increase productivity, team morale, self-confidence, sense of importance, and communication skills amongst your team.  Training should be viewed as a reward for continued employee loyalty.  If training is marketed correctly as an investment in the employees, your team will be excited to attend and see this as an additional benefit to them.</p><p><strong><u>Excuses for Avoiding Training</u></strong></p><p>I have heard all the typical excuses for avoiding training.  Here are some examples and my particular spin on how to turn these negative attitudes into positive solutions.</p><p><strong><em>""It's too expensive""    </em></strong>Yes, it can be expensive. Or, it can be viewed as an <strong><em>investment</em></strong> into the future of your organization.   What is the cost of defending a Fair Housing law suit?  What is the cost of homes/spaces sitting vacant because your staff does not understand the concept pre-leasing? How much does your Worker's Compensation insurance increase due to injuries that could have been avoided with proper training? What is the cost of defending a sexual harassment claim, or a wrongful termination?  Each one of these scenarios has the potential to cost your organization thousands and thousands of dollars.  Proper staff training can<strong><em> save</em></strong> you money due to increased knowledge and professionalism; not to mention decreased staff turnover.</p><p><strong><em>""We don't have time.""  </em></strong>I hear this often enough to wonder if trainers are the only ones who have time for training!  Property Management has its own monthly timeline that we all understand.  Training should be scheduled after rent week, not on Monday mornings, and not on the day of month end for accounting.  Yes we have renewals, inspections, move outs, move ins, bills to process, resident issues to address, and turnovers to complete.  But each of these tasks can be scheduled around training.   Try seeking input from your front-line team to determine the best time to schedule training. It is not okay to have our teams performing below standard or being assigned tasks that they do not fully understand.  Taking a little time to show them the correct procedures will make their time spent on the job much more productive and therefore saving precious time.   <strong><em>Not </em></strong>making time for training could prove to be costly to your organization.</p><p><strong><em>""We can't afford to have our team away from the property."" </em></strong> Understandably, closing the office may not be realistic as no one wants to miss a potential sale/rental.  There are other options to employ; such as having two sessions in one day and alternating employees so the office remains open. Or, have staff participate in an on-line course or webinar.  Blended learning opportunities, (offering both live and on-line training) has proven to be very successful as employees get a global perspective of the topic.  </p><p><strong><em>""Why do we need training when HR or a Manager can handle some teaching?"" </em></strong>Your in-house experts are indeed valuable to your organization and they should be involved with training company policies and procedures.  But what if they have not been brought up to speed with new laws? Or what if their work load is too heavy to expand into training?

This is the market you want to be in!  Oregon mobile home park sellers are seeing high demand for their product, and a park with good fundamentals in strong locations -- priced correctly -- will sell quickly.</p>",959,994,1580,16137,column,und,Ty Downing: Market Snapshot Manufactured Home Communities in Oregon,"<p><strong>Supply and Demand</strong></p><p>The primary drivers of this sales activity are the usual suspects:  supply and demand.  In the past couple decades, the cost to develop new manufactured home communities in Oregon (and most of the U.S.) has risen to the point that it is impossible to generate a compelling financial return with a newly constructed park.  Add to that the number of parks that are closed, or redeveloped to other uses, and it's clear that we operate in a market with a very restricted current supply - and no future new supply.</p><p>Meanwhile, demand for parks is climbing.</p><p>According to United Van Lines, Oregon is the most-moved-to destination in the United States for the past two years.  If you are buying or selling real estate in Oregon, you likely already know this!   People really want to live here. </p><p>The Multifamily NW Apartment Report released this spring shows falling vacancy rates in every Oregon/SE Washington market it surveys.  Vacancy in Portland/Vancouver, Salem, and Eugene averages just under 3%.  Bend is seeing 1.5% vacancy rate... and dropping!</p><p>Another recent factor driving demand is the influence of Wall Street and investment fund managers.  In 2003, Berkshire Hathaway purchased Clayton Homes and inserted its influence in a big way; designing, building, selling, and financing manufactured homes.  This single event began to alter the perception of investing in manufactured home communities. </p><p>Fast forward to now:  the largest private equity group in the U.S. -- the Carlyle Group - is investing in mobile home parks; Sam Zell, the billionaire American business magnate, is the largest owner of mobile home parks in this country; and Clayton is still crushing it as the largest source of new modular and manufactured homes in the nation.</p><p>We've seen out-of-state interest surge right here in our market:  At Western Equities, we've closed on $11,000,000 of mobile home park sales in the past year - with just one of our buyers!  This buyer is a private equity fund manager, and he has another $10,000,000 committed in offers or pending sales with us.  High-power investors like this have, collectively, a tangible effect the mobile home park sales market.</p><p><strong>Effect on the Market</strong></p><p>Not surprisingly, the limited supply and growing demand for parks has pushed sale prices up, and Cap Rates down.  Prices up, and Cap Rates down?  That's a seller's market!</p><p>""Cap Rate"" is short for Capitalization Rate, which is the rate of return if an investor were to pay cash for the purchase price.  Cap Rate is the most important initial indicator of the return on investment a property will produce.  The formula to determine Cap Rate of a property is Net Operating Income (NOI) divided by Purchase Price.</p><p>Cap Rates vary widely with the unique nature of mobile home parks - and reliable cap rate data is available for only about half of the parks sold on the market.  Investors and brokers in today's market are seeing steady cap rate compression in a majority of Oregon markets.  For healthy parks in strong locations, the Cap Rate range in 2010 was typically between 7-8 _ %.  Today, those parks tend to sell at 6 to 7% Cap Rate, or even lower.</p><p>One recent sale really affects the 2015 YTD Oregon Cap Rate and price per space averages:  Songbrook, a 140-space, award-winning manufactured home community sold on June 10th for $13,800,000 - a stunning $98,571 per space, and a 5.0% Cap Rate!  Songbrook was developed and sold by Troy Brost, a noted industry expert who has been a past board member and president of MHCO.</p><p>Large parks tend to be well-capitalized, in larger towns or cities, with very low vacancy, less collection loss, fewer deferred maintenance issues, and a significant management operation.  Essentially, there is lower investor risk, so the returns are smaller.</p><p>Nationally, big funds managers and institutional investors are looking to 'park' multiple millions of dollars, and because of low returns in other investment options, that money is increasingly used to invest in manufactured home communities.  Even private investors are rolling large into Oregon parks - i.e., the reported buyer of Songbrook.  This demand is significant in driving prices up, and pushing returns down.</p><p>The value of smaller parks is increasing as well.  Currently in Oregon, there are about 15 smaller (less than 100 spaces) parks listed for sale, with Cap Rates that are advertised between 6-12%.  This wide range indicates the diverse nature of smaller parks, which are often very different from each other.</p><p>Price Per Space is another interesting indicator when looking at property values, but there is such huge discrepancy when comparing parks - especially smaller ones - that Price Per Space is generally a secondary calculation.  Currently, there is an RV park on the market at $6,000 per space, compared with nearly $100,000 per space in the Songbrook sale. </p><p>Both of these are extreme examples; a more 'typical' Price Per Space range is $30-60k, and is influenced by many factors singular to that property. </p><p>Pricing your park correctly is critical to selling promptly.  There are several parks on the market that have been available for multiple years - clearly priced incorrectly for their market. </p><p>Consult an experienced park broker.  It's our job to know the many parks and markets that exist, and to personally know many of the sellers, buyers, brokers, lenders, vendors, and other industry people that collectively affect the value of Oregon parks.  There is a ton of activity right now, and not all of it is apparent to investors without deep connections in the mobile home park industry.  There are a lot of interesting and very relevant histories out there that inform our opinion and strategy when selling parks!</p><p><u><strong>Keep an eye out for my next article:  ""Buying and Selling MH Parks in a Hot Market"".</strong></u></p><p><em>Ty Downing is a licensed real estate broker at Western Equities, and a mobile home park investor.

Practically speaking, this means that if you know about a particular danger or threat of danger, as a landlord you must take reasonable steps to reduce or eliminate that danger.</span></p><p>The real question of course is what are the ""reasonable steps"" to take?  At the basic level, you should make sure that you have adequate lighting that is well-maintained to illuminate the park streets at night (i.e., replace those burned out bulbs).  Your resident manager should also conduct several walk-throughs throughout the day, preferably in the early morning and evening hours to note any problems.  If you have a perimeter fence around your park, make sure that it is kept in good repair and that entrance gates are working and secure. </p><p>Part of the obligation to keep your park safe is to also promptly enforce all park rules with written warnings and/or eviction notices if necessary.  A good example would be an unauthorized occupant staying with one of your tenants who you have reason to suspect is involved in park thefts.  Even if you  don't have solid proof of the thefts, you can rely on the fact that the person is not an authorized tenant and evict on that basis alone.  You should also immediately evict any particular tenant who is causing trouble.  (Hint:  Consider a simple no-cause eviction notice.)</p><p>If you've done all these things and are still having problems, do you have to hire a security guard?  Probably not, but it all depends on the circumstances.  The test is what is reasonable to eliminate or reduce the danger.  In some cases, that might mean installing security cameras if it would reduce thefts and it is financially reasonable (and in this day and age, security cameras are relatively inexpensive and easy to install).  In other cases, it might be reasonable to install a perimeter fence to keep out pedestrians cutting through the park (and helping themselves to tenants' personal property).</p><p>In the end, you will be held to the standard of providing a reasonably safe park for your tenants.  If you know about a particular danger or potential danger, take immediate steps to reduce that danger.  While you can't eliminate every threat, you can reduce your risk of liability by addressing foreseeable threats. </p>",839,1506,0,1502,1533,839,1,1414433982,1415042486,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13511,"<br><p>ORS 90.510(4) provides:</p><p>Every landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall provide a written rental agreement, except as provided by ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.710"">90.710 (Causes of action)</a>(2)(d).

At issue are a statute on trees in rented spaces (ORS 90.727), a statute on ""unilateral amendment"" of a rental agreement (ORS 90.510(4)), the terms of the parties' lease, and the trial court's award of attorney fees incurred in court-annexed arbitration. <a name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p><br><p>The Court found in favor of the plaintiff-tenant. Setting aside the fact that in trial, the tenant put on evidence that the prior landlord had always cleaned up tree limbs that littered spaces after a storm, the main issue was fairly straight forward: Does the unilateral amendment language of ORS 90.510(b) require the landlord to actually amend the rental/lease agreement <em>(as argued by the tenant),</em>or is it automatic under subsection (4)(c) which provides that ""(c)ertain specific statutes automatically require that the rental/lease agreement is changed"" <em>(as argued by the landlord)</em>.<a name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p><br><p>The Court held that although ORS 90.510(4)(b) explicitly allows landlords to unilaterally amend the rental/lease agreements to allocate responsibility, the enumerated statutes (including hazard tree statute) are <em>not automatically effective</em>.  <em>That is, the rental/lease agreement actually has to be unilaterally amended</em>.  In other words, contrary to the position taken by the park owner in the above case, in order to gain the benefit of allocating responsibility between landlords and tenants for trees on a space, management was first required to affirmatively ""unilaterally amend"" the rental/lease agreement.</p><br><p>Although the Court did not get into specifics as how this is done, it is not difficult to comply, e.g.  send to each tenant a single page amendment, stating that pursuant to ORS 90.510(4)(b), their rental/lease agreement is  '_hereby amended to adopt ORS 90.727 Maintenance of Trees in Rented Spaces).""  Either the statute should be quoted <em>verbatim</em>, or a copy attached to the unilateral amendment.  And of course, the amendment should be included in each tenant's file.</p><br><p>So the take-away for MHP landlords is that if you want the protection/enforcement provisions of the following statutes (and your current rental/lease agreement does not already contain them), you should make a unilateral amendment:</p><p>-      ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.530"">90.530 (Pets in facilities)</a>; </p><p>-      ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.533"">90.533 (Conversion of billing method for garbage collection and disposal)</a>;</p><p>-      ORS 90.537 (Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges); </p><br><p>-      ORS <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.543"">90.543 (Utility or service charge billing for large manufactured dwelling parks)</a>;</p><p>-      <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.600"">90.600 (Increases in rent)</a>;</p><p>-      <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.725"">90.725 (Landlord or agent access to rented space)</a>; and</p><p>-      <a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.727"">90.727 (Maintenance of trees in rented spaces)</a>.</p><br><p>At the end of MHCO's rental and lease agreements, the following provision appears, which should serve as a prompt for all landlords to issue a unilateral amendment document to tenants when (a) permitted by Oregon law, and (b) the provision is not already contained in the rental/lease agreement:</p><br><p>TENANT understands and agrees that in the event of any changes in local, State or Federal laws affecting the parties' rights or remedies herein, LANDLORD, in LANDLORD'S sole discretion, may request that TENANT sign one or more written addenda expressly incorporating such changes into this Agreement. TENANT'S failure to sign such written addenda within ten (10) days of LANDLORD'S written request to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement. No such change shall be retroactively applied to any circumstance that occurred prior to the date such new law became effective. Notwithstanding the preceding, LANDLORD shall have no duty to amend, alter or adjust this Agreement due to any laws or ordinances enacted after the Commencement Date, regarding Rent, Rent control, Rent adjustment, or any other limitation, restriction or provision affecting or limiting the amount of Rent LANDLORD may charge for this Space.

""To Submeter or Not to Submeter?"" </p>",959,994,1580,16046,column,und,"Water Sub-metering In Oregon by Erik Twenge, General Manager, Jet Utilities","<p><span style=""text-align: justify;"">That is the question on the minds of most </span>MHCO<span style=""text-align: justify;""> members we speak to. As you have likely noticed, the costs of water, sewer, and other utilities has increased exponentially in the last few years for both commercial and residential properties alike. The addition of unrelated or undefined fees, such as street maintenance, base charges, and additional services, has become commonplace. Combine that with careless usage of water by tenants and you have a perfect storm for losing revenue. Since we cannot directly control these increasing costs or the careless usage, it is nearly impossible to try and keep up by using rent increases alone.</span></p><p>Our recommendation is to focus on what you can control: who is directly paying for the utility expense. According to the Alliance for Water Efficiency (http://www.allianceforwaterefficiency.org), the average submetered customer uses up to 20% less than a customer on a master metered system. In our professional experience, we have seen decreases of up to 40%. It is really no surprise that when you transfer the responsibility to the tenant, they instantly become more aware of the leaks and conservation behaviors that they had been ignoring previously. It is just human nature that if something doesn'tcost you anything, you are less likely to be conscientious.</p><p>In order to place this responsibility on the tenant and get control of your utility expenses, you need to convert your park to the ""Submeter Billing Method"" outlined in the Oregon statutes. This can be a daunting task to take on alone, so it is important that you use someone who is an expert. We have spent the last few years immersed in research and have designed Jet Utilities' Submeter Conversion Program around the laws specific to Oregon. We have consulted the best minds in the business, including many Coalition board members, as well as independent council. We can confidently call ourselves experts in not only regulations and project management, but also in the actual installation of the system. Jet has its own licensed journeyman plumbers who are dedicated to the installation of submeters at mobile home parks. We have the knowledge and experience to handle a park of any size, with any type of plumbing material, anywhere in Oregon, Washington, or California.</p><p>We are confident that submetering is the right thing to do for your manufactured home community. The largest obstacle that many owners face after realizing their need to submeter is finding a way to fund the project. Until recently, your choices have been very limited: use your own capital or try and secure financing on your own. Neither of those is very attractive or very easy to do given the current economic state. Jet Utilities' Submeter Conversion Program offers owners and managers a turn key solution including the funding for the equipment and installation. There are no loans to qualify for, no up-front capital, and no cost to you. How can we do this, you ask? It is simple. We already have the funding for these projects. We simply install an Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) System and utility grade water meters at each space, and then bill you a flat monthly fee that Oregon law allows you to pass directly through to the tenants.</p><p>There are some very important laws and regulations that go into the preparation of this as well as the requirement for a Unilateral Amendment to the Rental Agreement which is now available to MHCO members in the ""Forms"" section of  the MHCO website. (<u>MHCO Form 14 - Unilateral Amendment to Rental Agreement for Sub-Metering)</u>. This is the first step in preparing for Submeter Conversion.</p><p>For more information and a quote for your park, please visit our website <a href=""http://www.jetutilities.com"">www.jetutilities.com</a> or call 1-844-JET-UTIL (844-538-8845) and ask for Erik.</p>",23,1506,0,1502,1533,23,1,1421759844,1512942459,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,12898,"<p>The title of this Community Update should have caught your attention.

My answer is no, I cannot and no longer do"".</p>",959,994,1580,15998,column,und,Water Submetering in Your Community,"<p>Both Landlords and Tenants agree of the importance of sub-metering; it is a win-win proposition. Enduring years of Landlord/Tenant Coalition, one of the most daunting tasks was demonstrating Landlords do not have safes' locked full of money. Financing options simply did not exist to fund mandatory sub-metering. Where were Landlords to find upwards of $750+ per homesite to install water sub-meters? Of course, Landlords proved their argument and negotiated the right to unilaterally amend rental agreements to permit community-wide sub-metering; creating provisions to recapture installation expenses by billing Tenants. Considering a new program now available, I believe every Landlord should sub-meter sooner than later!</p><p>Now available is a sub-meter and installation program at zero expense to any Landlord wanting to install new or replace old sub-meter systems. No applications, no qualifications, and no money down gets you state of the art wireless monitored sub-meters (water, electric, and gas are all available). What's the catch? ... the Landlord signs a 10 year Billing Agreement with the provider, in which the Tenant pays. So, how does it work?</p><p>First, the meters are purchased/installed/administered/maintained/repaired/monitored/insured/read/etc. by an Independent 3rd party. Just as all meter reading companies, this 3rd party charges a monthly fee for their service ... it is their cost of doing business. In Eugene, this 3rd party charges nearly 1/2 less of what EWEB (Eugene Water and Electric Board) charges it's customers. Second, per ORS 90, the 3rd party bills the Tenant the cost of the sub-meter and installation over a minimum of 60 months. The sub-metering process is complicated; no worries, this 3rd party is experienced, has been in business for nearly a decade, has all the systems and sample notices in place, and handles the entire process on behalf of the Landlord.</p><p>The Bottom line: local government agencies and utility companies use Landlords to pass through their exorbitant ""fees"" and rate increases, in which Landlords are forced to carry until the next ""rent"" increase ... making the Landlord the greedy bad guy. Prior to sub-metering, utility expenses were 23% of my rent; my monthly invoices now line item sub-meter every utility possible. My rents are now very competitive within the market and I have direct control over costs. I see every reason why all Landlords should do the same.</p><p>Indeed, it sounds too good to be true ... it is.

We all should have our structure to accomplish goals of our management direction. Mentioned in this article are suggestions that are critical to our businesses, service to our residents, retention of employees, and to stay out of court.</p><br><p>I'm sure you're already a dedicated successful business person. Even with the busy schedules we have today, is it worth your time and money to be an more effective park owner. These suggestions I will present are proven to work: in one park, for example, there have been only three management teams in the last thirty years, each staying ten years. A dedicated staff have stayed and performed very well for five to nineteen years. They have eighty five residents who have been living in the park for ten or more years with fifteen residents being at the park for twenty or more years. Survey results show resident satisfaction as ""happy"" and they would recommend the park to family and friends.</p><br><p>A good management team is the biggest factor to success of our businesses.</p><br><p>Many find that the use of a professional property management company is critical. It can be risky to operate your park without a full and complete knowledge of all current laws and trends. You must ask yourself if you have that knowledge or the time to do re-search necessary to effectively run your park.</p><br><p>Our business is far too complicated for us to know all aspects of a changing environment. Whether it is local politics, timely and correct response to personnel and resident issues, or help with business strategies, it is very complicated and costly to make un-informed decisions. It's difficult to be effective at all things at all times. (Keep in mind that your WMA local representative is an important source of information regarding local laws and regulations.)</p><br><p>Just as property managers have specialists; our businesses should have specialists within our parks with specific responsibilities.  Without specific assignments no one will feel responsible for tasks.</p><br><p>As a reminder, the following suggestions may be helpful in managing your business.</p><br><p><strong>""Park within a Park"" Rental Homes</strong></p><br><p>Today, many of us have come to rely upon park rentals to maintain profitability and cash flow. If this is the case for your business, someone in your organization must have your rental business as their first responsibility. Prospective renters have to be found and vetted, and decisions made based on the data collected. Do you want to be the collector of all this information? Probably not.</p><br><p>Knowing the reasons why people choose your park is also import-ant. It's good to be aware of the reasons people move in or out. What motivated them to select your park? Using a questionnaire to find out this information will help reveal trends that may help you to manage your rentals more effectively. How can you know your rental business if you don't have data to support decisions and the future for your rental business?</p><br><p>When selling or refinancing a park, buyers and lenders can make informed decisions if you are well documented. Financing can be difficult when rentals are big part of your revenue and expenses. It is a confidence builder for your loan representative and their loan committee if a solid case can be made that you are managing your rental business well.</p><br><p>Develop a ""work-order"" process, so renters can let you know if something needs to be repaired.  Their satisfaction will keep turn-over low.</p><br><p><strong>Know your Inventory</strong></p><br><p>Knowing your inventory is a key factor in projecting your future rental business and cash needs.   With up to date information, you will know what each home needs in order to be ready for rental.</p><p>Homes need to be safe and acceptable to be rented. If you have a few rentals, it is easy to know the specifics of each home. If you have fifty homes rented and ten needing work, organized and specific data is needed to know which home should be scheduled first for refurbishing.</p><br><p>Curb appeal is a first and lasting impression. People will form opinions about your business based on what they see first.</p><br><p>Consider a color pallet for homes to be painted. (I'm sure we have all seen resident or manager se-lections that are less attractive than we would like them to be.) Keeping a consistent color pallet across your park will have an aesthetically pleasing effect. If you do this, there will be no surprises when you visit your park.</p><br><p><strong>Keep an Eye on Past Due Rents</strong></p><br><p>Our life blood is collecting rents.  Monitoring the past due amounts, identifying chronic slow payers, issuing three and sixty day notices, and being a bill collector is a critical aspect of park management. Telephone calls and letters need to be sent, followed up, and timely action needs to be taken to collect rent.</p><br><p>Collection communication takes a special type of person. The per-son responsible for collection may or may not have the personality to collect from people they see every day. If not, see if someone else in your organization would be a better fit.</p><br><p><strong>Managing our Managers and Staff</strong></p><br><p>Once people have been found, hired, and trained, keeping them around is very important. Employees leaving is costly and de-moralizing. It's important to let employees know what is expected of them, and inspect their work.  Document their work tasks, and have periodic reviews. This may seem like a lot of work, but the benefits to your business will be great.</p><br><p>One of a manager's important tasks is to be visible to residents and staff. They must be aware of the local politics, changes to city laws and what new issues are the current hot topics. They are your eyes and ears to what is being talked about by your residents.</p><br><p>The following are some ideas to consider when you want loyalty from employees:</p><p>-Paid vacation</p><p>-Health Insurance, full or partial payment by park</p><p>-Give managers permission to take a ""resident to lunch"" or to do something they                           feel will help resident satisfaction</p><p>-Allow your manager to grant limited ""personal time"" for doctors appointments                            and family issues</p><p>-Allow law mandated sick days</p><p>-Surprise ""half day off "". It doesn'tcost much, and will buy productivity when                             they come back</p><p>-""All Hands"" quarterly luncheon to review past performance and plans for the                               near short term</p><p>-For special efforts and major projects completed, give paid days off, or gift                                   certificates to take their family out for dinner</p><br><p>It is not the size of thank you, it is the recognition. don't we all like the recognition from work that we can share with family and friends?</p><br><p>Let employees know ""your way"" of handling resident questions, resident requests, and complaints. </p><br><p><strong>Homes Being Vandalized</strong></p><br><p>Have you had thefts or vandalism to resident homes, yard, and car, park facilities, or had equipment being stolen? It's important to make sure that your staff members are driving the park all day. Make them your eyes and ears for suspicious people or delivery trucks. Have managers develop a relationship with local police.</p><br><p>Train your Neighborhood Watch group and recognize their efforts with periodic coffee and cookies, or lunch.</p><br><p>Buy a used police car and rotate it around the interior and exterior of the park. In one park a resident bought the car for $1,000. It looks like an undercover police car and is working to scare petty thieves.  Pit bulls, armed residents, and vigilantes are not suggested.</p><br><p>I know some of the suggestions will take a while to implement and some of these you won'tlike, however it's necessary to make the effort to do something that will be noticed by employees and residents.</p><br><p>You will find that if you have taken the time to do some of the things that were mentioned, the small stuff will come more easily.</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><em><strong>MHCO would like to thank WMA (Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association) for this informative article.

The question is: do we make a mistake by not reminding them from time to time about all of the things they would truly miss if these things went away or were even curtailed? And while it is true that most of the things we do to operate and manage our parks are for reasons like the bottom line, they for sure benefit the residents. Take rent increases, as an example. No one likes them, of course. The sting of a rent increase may be lessened if the residents realize all of the things the owners and managers do with the residents' best interests at heart. Residents rarely think about what an inviting mobilehome park you provide and what it takes to keep it that way. And, why should they? It's the owners' and managers' job to keep things running smoothly. The next time you: raise the rent, amend a rule, change a policy, reframe it in your own mind and think ""what's the benefit to the resident?"". Everyone's favorite radio station is WIIFM (What's In It For Me).

Not to satisfy your customer, but to delight your customer. And when you wake up in the morning, start thinking about it. At night, think about it. And then dream about it.""</p><br><p>            Remember too, that people generally will go along with a change if given a reason. It does not need to be the most elegant or elaborate reason. The point is to five a reason, i.e., ""Yes, garbage cost will be passed through to the residents and let me explain the reason why... "". Most of the time the residents will feel they had their say, and they will be satisfied with the answer. Get in the habit of saying ""and let me explain the reason why... "". Saying this will be a boon to your communication skills and thus your resident relations.</p><br><p>            Several years ago, our state MHA offered the Accredited Community Manager (ACM) course. This course has been developed over the years by the Manufactured Housing Institute in conjunction with community owners. It is a top-notch course that dives deep into management and operations with sections on financials, resident relations, repairs and maintenance, and much more. The ACM instructor, Chrissy Jackson, a community owner, gave the class a tip for resident relations. It's the What We Do for You list. Chrissy recommended making a list of things, big and small, noticeable and unnoticed, that you do for the residents. Ideas for using the What We Do for You list could be printed once a year in your newsletter, put it on your website, as a hand out in the office, or laminated and posted in the office. It's also a tool for your manager, too. In the hubbub of their duties, it is easy for manager to forget why the community is a great place to live. The What We Do for You list needs to be top of mind for them.</p><br><p>It keeps them enthusiastic about the mobilehome park and what a great value it offers the residents. What doesn'twork is when a resident complains to a manager and the manager's response is, ""Uh...  let me get back to you."" The manager's response needs to be energetic and positive after hearing out the resident. Our managers should add to this list monthly. Do you think there is nothing new that you do for your residents? Or do you think the residents know everything the community does and provides? Think again. This might be new information to your residents but it's a good refresher, too. Here is a sample:</p><br><p align=""center"">A LETTER TO THE RESIDENTS OF ABC MOBILEHOME PARK</p><br><p>Dear Residents,</p><br><p>Thank you for another wonderful year at ABC. We have had some fun with our first annual Clean Up Contest. Looking back at the year in review, we have done some very nice improvements to the park and will continue that trend in to 2018.</p><br><p>Streets, Sewer and Water:</p><br><p>Most years we make a significant street repair or replacement project; our harsh Midwest climate is tough on streets. With an older park, such as our ABC, the water lines and sewer lines are repaired and replaced a lot. We thank our residents who are careful about what they put down their sinks and toilets and refrain from grease, cigarettes, and wipes getting flushed or poured down the drains.</p><br><p>Water Conservation and Water Meters</p><br><p>Adding individual meters has resulted in over 1,000,000 gallons of water consumption reduction per year! We also notify residents when their consumption spikes, so they can remedy a dripping faucet or other leak. Conserving water is an important contribution to sustainability. Consistently looking for water main leaks adds to this effort and contains operational cost.</p><br><p>New Homes:</p><br><p>Buying new homes for the community helps upgrade the overall appearance of the park. Buying pre-owned homes has offered our residents the opportunity to move up to a newer or larger home. When a resident buys a ""new"" park owned home, we often buy that resident's existing mobilehome. This helps them buy the ""new"" home.</p><br><p>LED and Sustainability:</p><br><p>We have installed some LED lighting in our outside storage area and on individual lots where the yard lights were repaired or replaced. Some of the hills have been planted with shrubs for erosion resistance and to cut down on mowing, as per a city initiative to curb carbon emissions.</p><br><p>Appearance of Homes and Home Sites:</p><br><p>During our Spring and Fall Clean Up Campaigns, our managers did a masterful job of working with the residents to get the mobilehomes and home sites looking clean and cared for as possible. There was a lot of power washing, painting, skirting and general junk removal. Our managers and residents worked together on this year's clean up so that residents can feel proud of where they live.</p><br><p>New Resident Screening:</p><br><p>The managers do their best to screen prospective residents so that when a home in the community sells a good resident moves in. Further, we use a service for background checks. Our managers provide onsite management that is backed up by our regional property manager, making sure that there is always someone available in person, by email, or by phone to listen and address questions or concerns.</p><br><p>Selling Tenant Owned Homes:</p><br><p>There are a lot of people that would like to move in to your community. The many inquiries and calls we receive is a good indication of demand. Our website benefits residents by providing basic information about the park, rules and policies, lot rent, homes for sale, etc. We also help our residents with the paperwork or selling their home.</p><br><p>Again, thank you for the wonderful year. Please feel free to reach out to management if you have a question or concern.</p><br><p>            Ultimately, the mobilehome park's job is to operate in such a way that the homeowners' home value is at least maintained, if not enhanced. Mobilehome ownership may be one of the tenants' largest assets. We owe it to them to make the mobilehome park as clean, well run, and attractive as possible.</p><br><p align=""center""><strong><em><span style=""font-size:14px;"">Joanne Stevens</span></em></strong> is a real estate broker specialist in listing and selling mobilehome parks and manufactured home communities throughout the U.S. She can be reached at 319.378.6785 phone; 319.365.9833 fax; and email: joannestevens@joannemstevens.com.</p><p align=""center""><span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""text-align: -webkit-center;"">This article is reprinted with permission from WMA Reporter November 2017 'Resident Relations Feature Article'.</span></span></p>",23,1506,0,1502,1533,23,1,1525194796,1525194796,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13251,"<br><p>Under Oregon law, anyone, who for compensation, arranges or undertakes or offers to undertake or submit a bid to construct, alter, repair...for another, any building...structure, project...or improvement attached to real estate, is a ""contractor.""  See, ORS 701.055(3)  Although there are several exceptions to this law, the ramifications of this broad definition can have a significant legal effect on park owners and managers who have work performed in their community.  Here are some general rules to avoid liability when working with contractors:</p><br><br>",959,994,1580,16351,column,und,WORKING WITH CONTRACTORS,"<p><strong><em><u>Make sure that your contractor is licensed and bonded with the Construction Contractor's Board (""CCB""</u></em></strong><strong><em>)</em></strong></p><br><p>The person submitting a bid to perform work at the park should provide you with their CCB number.  The number should appear on their business card and on any proposal to perform work.  Do not accept an oral representation that a person is registered with the CCB - get the number and then check the contractor out with the CCB.  Using the number will allow you to verify whether the person is registered, and determine whether there are any open claims against them.  This can be important, since even though CCB licensees must be bonded (in the amount of $15,000 for general contractors and $10,000 for specialty contractors<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>), too many claims at one time can deplete the bond.  Additionally, licensing requires that the contractor maintain public liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 for general and specialty (non-residential) contractors.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p><br><p>Additionally, should the work not be performed according to industry standards, if the worker is licensed, you will have up to one year within which to bring a claim against him through the CCB.  If the CCB determines that correction must be made, it will require that the licensee perform the work.  If the licensee fails or refuses to do so, you may file a claim for the cost of repair against his bond</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Make sure your contractor provides proof of worker's compensation insurance.  </u></em></strong></p><br><p>""Employer"" means any person... who contracts to pay a remuneration for and secures the right to direct and control the services of any person. ORS 656.005(13)(a).  Thus, if you hire someone to perform certain work, say, to repair or re-roof the clubhouse, and they incur an on-the-job injury, you would likely be deemed to be the ""employer"" if they have no insurance  If the injured worker received medical treatment, Oregon's State Accident Insurance Fund ('SAIF"") would send you the bill for reimbursement.  Depending upon the injury, this could amount to thousands of dollars.</p><br><p>The best way to protect against using an uninsured worker is to make a habit of only hiring contracting companies who employ their own labor force.  Generally, the larger the company, the less risk there is that they are ""going bare,"" i.e. not paying their workers compensation insurance premiums.  The expense</p><p>of such insurance can cause some small contractors to forego the cost, but represent to consumers that they do have such insurance.  Verification is the best policy.</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Avoiding Disputes Regarding Unpaid Liens</u></em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><br><p>If you have work performed through a general contractor, i.e. he or she is employing one or more subcontractors, it is imperative that you make sure the subcontractor(s) are paid on time.  If you pay the general, but the general does not pay the sub, the sub may still retain lien rights against you.  If the general contractor becomes insolvent, or otherwise fails to pay the sub, the park owner could be placed in the position of having to pay the sub to avoid the filing of a lien on the property - even though the general contractor has already been paid for the same work.</p><br><p>There are several ways to keep this result from occurring: (a) pay the sub directly and obtain a lien release; (b) pay the general when he or she provides you with a lien release from the sub; (c) never pay the general beyond the value of the work performed (i.e. don't let the general be paid for work that has not yet been done) (d) make sure you verify that the payment is for work that has actually been done on the job; (e) pay attention to the Notice of Right to Lien forms that you receive, so you know which subs would actually have valid lien claims.</p><br><p>Similarly, you want to make sure that your general contractor stays within his budgeted amount for the job, and does not submit for payment beyond the agreed-upon amount, or for work that has not yet been performed or supplies that have not been delivered.</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Selection of Contractors</u></em></strong><strong><em>.  </em></strong></p><br><p>As with the selection of all professionals, the best way to select a good contractor is by word of mouth - i.e. referrals from satisfied customers.  This is the best advertising one can have.  While there is nothing wrong with starting out with the Yellow Pages, it is prudent to ask any selected contractor for a list of references.  Check a few of them out.  Questions to ask would include (a) Did the contractor do the promised work? (b) Was the work done on time and in a professional manner? (c) Were there any hidden costs, charges, expenses, or add-ons that weren'tdiscussed in advance? (d) Would the customer use them again?</p><br><p>And most important, don't accept the first bid that you receive.  Some contractors do not expect to get all of the jobs they bid - so bids can vary wildly from company to company.  When you receive a bid from a contractor you may be interested in using, have a conversation with him or her, just to make sure their approach to the project is the same as yours, and that the two of you are compatible. </p><br><p>Never hire a contractor without a written contract.  It doesn'thave to be fancy - but it should be professional looking.  It should cover (a) the scope of the work; (b) the price of the job; (c) the completion date<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>; (d) any warranties for the work to be performed (e.g. one year for all workmanship and material)<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>; (e) the payment schedule.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p>One last thought:  While mandatory mediation and arbitration is favored by many lawyers and can be a useful tool in the resolution of disputes, if there is such a clause in the contract and a dispute arises, the contractor may prevent CCB involvement if they give timely notification to the CCB.  Although this is not necessarily bad - some alternative dispute resolution processes are very good - park owners should keep it in mind when reviewing the terms of the contract.  If you want to retain CCB involvement in the event of a dispute, you may not wish to agree to an alternative dispute resolution provision in the written contract - and <em>visa versa.</em></p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> ORS 701.085 (2), (3).</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> ORS 701.105 (a), (b), (c).</p></div><div id=""ftn3""><p><a href=""#_ftnref3"" name=""_ftn3"" title="""">[3]</a> Most contracts will contain a <em>force majeur</em> clause, i.e. a provision saying that they will not be responsible for delays relating to weather, war, strike, acts of God, change orders, or matters outside of their control.</p></div><div id=""ftn4""><p><a href=""#_ftnref4"" name=""_ftn4"" title="""">[4]</a> Even if there are no express warranties, the requirement that the work be performed according to industry standards, still applies and may be enforced by the CCB.</p></div><div id=""ftn5""><p><a href=""#_ftnref5"" name=""_ftn5"" title="""">[5]</a> It is prudent to have a hold-back arrangement so that a final percentage is paid upon completion.

Additionally, licensing requires that the contractor maintain public liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 for general and specialty (non-residential) contractors.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p><br><p>Additionally, should the work not be performed according to industry standards, if the worker is licensed, you will have up to one year within which to bring a claim against him through the CCB.  If the CCB determines that correction must be made, it will require that the licensee perform the work.  If the licensee fails or refuses to do so, you may file a claim for the cost of repair against his bond</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Make sure your contractor provides proof of worker's compensation insurance.  </u></em></strong></p><br><p>""Employer"" means any person... who contracts to pay a remuneration for and secures the right to direct and control the services of any person. ORS 656.005(13)(a).  Thus, if you hire someone to perform certain work, say, to repair or re-roof the clubhouse, and they incur an on-the-job injury, you would likely be deemed to be the ""employer"" if they have no insurance  If the injured worker received medical treatment, Oregon's State Accident Insurance Fund ('SAIF"") would send you the bill for reimbursement.  Depending upon the injury, this could amount to thousands of dollars.</p><br><p>The best way to protect against using an uninsured worker is to make a habit of only hiring contracting companies who employ their own labor force.  Generally, the larger the company, the less risk there is that they are ""going bare,"" i.e. not paying their workers compensation insurance premiums.  The expense</p><p>of such insurance can cause some small contractors to forego the cost, but represent to consumers that they do have such insurance.  Verification is the best policy.</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Avoiding Disputes Regarding Unpaid Liens</u></em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><br><p>If you have work performed through a general contractor, i.e. he or she is employing one or more subcontractors, it is imperative that you make sure the subcontractor(s) are paid on time.  If you pay the general, but the general does not pay the sub, the sub may still retain lien rights against you.  If the general contractor becomes insolvent, or otherwise fails to pay the sub, the park owner could be placed in the position of having to pay the sub to avoid the filing of a lien on the property - even though the general contractor has already been paid for the same work.</p><br><p>There are several ways to keep this result from occurring: (a) pay the sub directly and obtain a lien release; (b) pay the general when he or she provides you with a lien release from the sub; (c) never pay the general beyond the value of the work performed (i.e. don't let the general be paid for work that has not yet been done) (d) make sure you verify that the payment is for work that has actually been done on the job; (e) pay attention to the Notice of Right to Lien forms that you receive, so you know which subs would actually have valid lien claims.</p><br><p>Similarly, you want to make sure that your general contractor stays within his budgeted amount for the job, and does not submit for payment beyond the agreed-upon amount, or for work that has not yet been performed or supplies that have not been delivered.</p><br><p><strong><em><u>Selection of Contractors</u></em></strong><strong><em>.  </em></strong></p><br><p>As with the selection of all professionals, the best way to select a good contractor is by word of mouth - i.e. referrals from satisfied customers.  This is the best advertising one can have.  While there is nothing wrong with starting out with the Yellow Pages, it is prudent to ask any selected contractor for a list of references.  Check a few of them out.  Questions to ask would include (a) Did the contractor do the promised work? (b) Was the work done on time and in a professional manner? (c) Were there any hidden costs, charges, expenses, or add-ons that weren'tdiscussed in advance? (d) Would the customer use them again?</p><br><p>And most important, don't accept the first bid that you receive.  Some contractors do not expect to get all of the jobs they bid - so bids can vary wildly from company to company.  When you receive a bid from a contractor you may be interested in using, have a conversation with him or her, just to make sure their approach to the project is the same as yours, and that the two of you are compatible. </p><br><p>Never hire a contractor without a written contract.  It doesn'thave to be fancy - but it should be professional looking.  It should cover (a) the scope of the work; (b) the price of the job; (c) the completion date<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>; (d) any warranties for the work to be performed (e.g. one year for all workmanship and material)<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a>; (e) the payment schedule.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p>One last thought:  While mandatory mediation and arbitration is favored by many lawyers and can be a useful tool in the resolution of disputes, if there is such a clause in the contract and a dispute arises, the contractor may prevent CCB involvement if they give timely notification to the CCB.  Although this is not necessarily bad - some alternative dispute resolution processes are very good - park owners should keep it in mind when reviewing the terms of the contract.  If you want to retain CCB involvement in the event of a dispute, you may not wish to agree to an alternative dispute resolution provision in the written contract - and <em>visa versa.</em></p><div> <hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%"" /><div id=""ftn1""><p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""">[1]</a> ORS 701.085 (2), (3).</p></div><div id=""ftn2""><p><a href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""">[2]</a> ORS 701.105 (a), (b), (c).</p></div><div id=""ftn3""><p><a href=""#_ftnref3"" name=""_ftn3"" title="""">[3]</a> Most contracts will contain a <em>force majeur</em> clause, i.e. a provision saying that they will not be responsible for delays relating to weather, war, strike, acts of God, change orders, or matters outside of their control.</p></div><div id=""ftn4""><p><a href=""#_ftnref4"" name=""_ftn4"" title="""">[4]</a> Even if there are no express warranties, the requirement that the work be performed according to industry standards, still applies and may be enforced by the CCB.</p></div><div id=""ftn5""><p><a href=""#_ftnref5"" name=""_ftn5"" title="""">[5]</a> It is prudent to have a hold-back arrangement so that a final percentage is paid upon completion.

He or she should be an active participant in other activities and lead by example.  In case of an actual emergency, the chairman and the community manager will be the center of operations and communications.  The chairman can assign duties to committee members, such as maintaining a list of community members with special needs or residents with special skills or expertise.</p><p>The training coordinator should be responsible for planning and holding actual evacuation or other types of disaster drills, depending on what potential problems face your community.  For example, if the community has a central shelter that resients can use in case of a tornado, you should have a ""mock"" emergency alert once or twice a year.  Encourage everyone to participate.  This will improve their own safety, and it will also help you find out if there are any flaws in the plan, such as an area whose residents cannot reach the shelter quickly or a breakdown in the system used to alert residents.</p><br><p>These drills should also include practice with the notification system.  Audio alarm systems should be tested regularly, and back-up systems should be practiced.  For example, if a phone chain is being used, it should be tried out at least twice a year, to see how long it takes everyone in the community to be notified and to make sure that phone numbers are current.</p><br><p>Similarly, with a door-to-door system, practices will help determine how long it takes to notify everyone, so that adjustments can be made.  In either system, make plans that would allow for some residents not being in the community when notification is needed.  For example, are some homes occupied for only part of the year?  Would some residents be at work when you need to notify them?</p><br><p>The communications specialist is responsible for community education.  Regular communication with residents through a newsletter or other publication is a good idea.  In addition to letting residents know about the community's disaster plan, encourage families to develop their own disaster plans.  Although not required by law, disaster plans should be provided to new residents as part of the move-in processing.</p><br><p>The emergency supplies person will work with the community management to establish a storage area for a supply of food, water, medical supplies, communications equipment and other items that would be needed in case a disaster strikes the community, and help cannot reach you right away.</p><br><p>The emergency supplies should be kept in an area that is unlikely to be damaged by any type of disaster.  The managers should check these supplies regularly to make sure that they are usable and up-to-date.  As part of their individual family disaster plan, residents should maintain their own emergency supplies, and a way to carry the supplies (a duffel bag or suitcase) in case an evacuation is required.</p><br><br>",23,1506,0,1502,1533,23,1,1464016586,1512942838,1,0,0,0,0,,"<p><strong>Question: </strong>We have an applicant who was pre-approved for residency, then purchased a home but did not show up to sign the rental agreement or moving into the home.
