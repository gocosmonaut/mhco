I will supply them and then answer. So, let's assume the following: (a) This is a periodic (i.e. month-to-month) tenancy; (b) The tenant has moved out of the home and it is now vacant; (c) The rents are not being paid; and lastly, let's assume that (d) The landlord was to be paid all past-due rent from the sale proceeds. However, before answering the question, however, let me point out a fatal error by this landlord - and many other landlords: They don't look at the Worst Case Scenario. I'm sure the Storage Agreement adequately covered what was to occur upon sale. But since we have a landlord now asking what happens if the sale does not occur by November 30, I'm led to believe the parties neglected to address (in writing) the possibility of failure.

So my responses are based upon my opinion alone. Until an appellate court rules on these issues - which is unlikely, since most such cases are never appealed - the best we can do is speculate. My answers are in italics below.</p><p>1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</p><p><em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident - even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in. A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p><p>2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?</p><p><em>Technically, yes. Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can - without your consent - alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed. [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p><p>3. Do we rescreen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?</p><p><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so - if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what? Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years? Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can - or will make the payments? That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced. Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved. The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent's individual credit score less important. The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse. It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.</em></p><p>4. If we do rescreen the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?</p><p><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above. If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing - and I have never seen any that do - the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge. I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so. A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria - with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules - would be a very difficult sell to most judges. It is unlikely that you would prevail. I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out. If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict. But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent in the future, is premature and likely to fail. </em></p><p>5. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?</p><p><em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease. It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy. If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them.</em></p>",Null,839,23,99999,0,100000,100001,839,1,1329150523,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,246,15745,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A:  Temporary Occupants and Implications for Rules and Regulations Screening and Eviction,"<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Not in my opinion.

The entire statute, which is lengthy, is found at ORS 90.675. (a) Can a landlord acquire a home that is in abandonment? Yes. Assuming that the abandonment process has been formally commenced, the landlord would have to wait for the 45 day period to expire and then if the property was over $8,000, it would have to be advertised and sold via sealed bid. The landlord can bid, but must make sure that the bid is high enough that it's not going to be snapped up by another higher bid. If the property is worth $8,000 or less, the landlord could dismantle or give away to a non-profit organization. But if the landlord wanted the home, he would have to advertise and auction and then pay the property taxes and could acquire it. (b) Can he or she bid during the sealed bid process? Yes, as mentioned above. However, sealed bids mean sealed bids - no free peek by the landlord, so he knows how much to make his bid for. The playing field must be level. (c) If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase it and at what price?

There is a lot to remember. Generally all of the answers are contained in ORS 90.630 [Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent]. Here is a short summary: o The landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy in a manufactured housing community by giving not less than 30 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant: o Violates a law or ordinance related to the tenant's conduct as a tenant, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with ORS 90.740 [Tenant Obligations]; o Violates a rule or rental agreement provision; o Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587; or o Fails to pay a (i) a late charge pursuant to ORS 90.260; (ii) A fee pursuant to ORS 90.302; or (iii) a utility or service charge pursuant to ORS 90.534 or 90.536. o The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the violation within the 30-day period specified in notice of violation. However, if substantially the same act or omission recurs within six months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy upon at least 20 days' written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy. In such cases, the tenant does not have a right to correct the violation - and the notice must so state. o Oregon's three strikes"" law only applies to cases in which the tenant is issued three 72-hour [or 144-hour] notices within a 12-month period.

Well water is not something you may separately charge the residents for under ORS 90.532. There is no recognized method under Oregon law to recover it separately from - or outside of - base rent. Since base rent may only be increased in accordance with the 90-day rent raise protocol described in ORS 90.600, there is no pass-through alternative for communities serviced by well water for drinking. Subsection (8) of ORS 90.532 limits utility charges for water through the following means: A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a: (a) Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005; (b) Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225; (c) People's utility district organized under ORS chapter 261; (d) Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62; (e) Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or (f) Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552. (9) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757. Your question does not indicate whether the new water system falls into one of the above categories. If it does, then you are entitled to assess a pass-through protocol, so long as the other submetering statutes are followed What follows is brief summary of the applicable statutes. As you will see, the issues are technical and complex. In short, you should secure competent legal advice from an expert familiar with your particular situation. This article or summary should not be relied upon to the exclusion of obtaining that legal advice. o 90.532 This statute sets forth the permissible billing methods park owners may use for their water charges. o 90.534 This statute describes how a landlord may charge for providing a utility or service directly to the residents' spaces by apportionment of the costs per space. o 90.536 This statute describes the use of submeters to each space and the appropriate billing method. o 90.537 This statute instructs landlords on how and when they may convert from one billing method to another. o 90.538 This statute describes the tenants' rights to inspect billing records when an owner converts from one billing system to another. In your case, since you are on well water, the only records I imagine you would have would be the well water maintenance costs, since there is no direct water charge to you. o 90.539 This statute describes the park owner's rights to access a resident's space to read the submeter. Conclusion. Without knowing more, it is hard to say definitively whether your proposed billing method [assuming the system is permissible under ORS 90.532(8)], would be allowed. However, my guess is that it is not. The reason is that the legislation and legislative history that resulted in these statutes is based upon much discussion and anecdotal experience. The categories and protocols are very specific. If you were to submeter, I suspect you could not blend"" your charges to include the equivalent of a fixed fee for everyone",Null,839,23,99999,0,100000,100001,839,1,1368559525,1512942464,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,347,15757,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A:  Boyfriend on Temp Occupant Agreement - What happens after they break up,"<p>Answer: A temporary occupant is not supposed to be paying the rent. You are not allowed to screen for the occupant's ability to pay, because they are not a tenant. Your acceptance of rent from the occupant creates an appearance that the occupant is really a tenant. Secondly, the law says that a temporary occupant may not live in the home unless there is a tenant there as well. Accordingly, if you accept rent from the temporary occupant in the absence of the tenant living there, it could create a situation where you have waived the temporary occupant status, and are now treating him as a full time tenant. Here are the rules under the temporary occupancy statute ORS 90.275: o The temporary occupant: o Is not a tenant entitled to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others; and o Does not have the rights of a tenant. o The temporary occupancy agreement may be terminated by: o The tenant without cause at any time; and o The landlord only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement. o The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure a violation that causes a landlord to terminate the temporary occupancy agreement. o Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, a landlord may screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record. The landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level. o A temporary occupancy agreement: o Must expressly include the above requirements; o May provide that the temporary occupant is required to comply with any applicable rules for the premises; and o May have a specific ending date. o The landlord, tenant and temporary occupant may extend or renew a temporary occupancy agreement or may enter into a new temporary occupancy agreement. o A landlord or tenant is not required to give the temporary occupant written notice of the termination of a temporary occupancy agreement. o The temporary occupant shall promptly vacate the dwelling unit if a landlord terminates a temporary occupancy agreement for material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement or if the temporary occupancy agreement ends by its terms. o Except in cases of discrimination (ORS 90.449) a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the tenant if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate or if the tenant materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement. o A temporary occupant is treated as a squatter if they continue to occupy the home after a tenancy has ended or after the tenant revokes permission for the occupancy by terminating the temporary occupancy agreement. o A landlord may not enter into a temporary occupancy agreement for the purpose of evading landlord responsibilities; o A tenant may not become a temporary occupant in the tenant's own dwelling unit; o A tenancy may not consist solely of a temporary occupancy. Each tenancy must have at least one tenant. In your case, it would appear that you could either terminate the tenant's tenancy since they vacated leaving the temporary occupant to occupy alone, a violation of the statute, or terminate the temporary occupant for the same reason. I would try a written notice to the temporary occupant, to see if they will voluntarily vacate. If they refuse, then you should retain counsel and proceed to evict him as a squatter. Do not, under any circumstances, accept rent from the temporary occupant.</p>",Null,839,23,99999,0,100000,100001,839,1,1370367235,1402810325,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,357,15756,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Resident Builds Carport - Sells Home - New Owner Wants to Take Home and Carport,"<p>Answer: This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws.

Here is a summary of the tenant duties under ORS 90.325: o Use the parts of the premises including the living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and dining room in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended. o Keep all areas of the premises under control of the tenant in every part as clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin, as the condition of the premises permits and to the extent that the tenant is responsible for causing the problem. The tenant shall cooperate to a reasonable extent in assisting the landlord in any reasonable effort to remedy the problem. o Dispose from the dwelling unit all ashes, garbage, rubbish and other waste in a clean, safe and legal manner. With regard to needles, syringes and other infectious waste, as defined in ORS 459.386, the tenant may not dispose of these items by placing them in garbage receptacles or in any other place or manner except as authorized by state and local governmental agencies. o Keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the tenant as clean as their condition permits. o Use in a reasonable manner all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other facilities and appliances including elevators in the premises. o Test at least once every six months and replace batteries as needed in any smoke alarm, smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm provided by the landlord and notify the landlord in writing of any operating deficiencies. o Behave and require other persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave in a manner that will not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors. The underscored portion above clearly applies. The next question is the right of access. That is covered in ORS 90.322. The statute is quite long and complicated. Here is a summary of the relevant portions applicable to your situation: o A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord's agent may enter into the tenant's dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant's exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors.

Do not hold onto them, as there is Oregon case law saying that doing so for an unreasonable amount of time can constitute acceptance. Include a letter with the checks reiterating what you told him about the necessity of the repairs and the need to sign the rental agreement. I hope the nature of the repairs and the amount of time he has to complete them are a part of the rental agreement. IF not they should be. The only real way to enforce this requirement is to make the repairs a written condition of the tenancy. Do not accept any rent from him unless and until the tenant has signed the rental agreement and it contains an explicit description of the work he is to do and a completion date. If he takes possession without having signed a written rental agreement, you may give him a 24-hour notice to terminate under ORS 90.403. The statute contemplates an improper subleasing arrangement which is not the case here. However, in all respects, it should work, since his possession is unauthorized and in possession without a signed rental agreement. Make sure that you use the proper form of notice, as this is not the same situation as giving a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct under ORS 90.396. Alternatively, if you have rules in the community that prohibit occupancy without a written rental agreement, you could issue a 30-day notice under ORS 90.630(1)(b).

For those interested, these statutes should be consulted. You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park's rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act. I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident. The main issue here is Fair Housing Laws.

One, you've accepted rent from the occupant for the last several months. For all intents and purposes, you have accepted him as a tenant - even though he is not there on a written rental agreement and even though you have no criminal background check on him. Even if your rules prohibit subleasing, that too, has been waived. In other words, all of the breaches you could have enforced against him and/or the tenants who subleased, have been waived and are now unenforceable. Here are the rules on waiver that apply in this situation [ORS 90.412]. While they are of no help in this situation, they may be helpful in the future. A landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord: o During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant; or o Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement. o A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if: o Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent; or o The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. o A landlord does not waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for a violation under any of the following circumstances: o The landlord and tenant agree otherwise after the violation has occurred. o The violation concerns the tenant's conduct and, following the violation but prior to acceptance of rent for three rental periods or performance, the landlord gives a written warning notice to the tenant regarding the violation that: o Describes specifically the conduct that constitutes the violation, either as a separate and distinct violation, a series or group of violations or a continuous or ongoing violation; o States that the tenant is required to discontinue the conduct or correct the violation; and o States that a reoccurrence of the conduct that constitutes a violation may result in a termination of the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.392, 90.398, 90.405 or 90.630. o The tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home, and the violation concerns: o Disrepair or deterioration of the manufactured dwelling or floating home; o A failure to maintain the rented space; o The termination is under ORS 90.396 [24-hour notices]. o The landlord accepts: o A last month's rent deposit collected at the beginning of the tenancy, regardless of whether the deposit covers a period beyond a termination date; o Rent distributed pursuant to a court order releasing money paid into court; or o Rent paid for a rent obligation not yet due and paid more than one rental period in advance. o For a continuous or ongoing violation, the landlord's written warning notice remains effective for 12 months and may be renewed with a new warning notice before the end of the 12 months. o A landlord that must refund rent shall make the refund to the tenant or other payer by personal delivery or first class mail. The refund may be in the form of the tenant's or other payer's check or in any other form of check or money. The most important thing you should do at this point is to try to determine if this occupant is a sexual predator. Oregon laws were revised a few years ago to provide that if an occupant is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587, you may unilaterally issue him a 30-day notice to vacate.

As most owners and managers know who have explored converting to submeters, the concept is relatively simple. But the devil is in the details, i.e. the statutes. The basic concept is that for communities with utilities [e.g. water and sewer] that are buried in the base rent, they may extract those charges from base rent, and pass them through to the residents directly for payment.

The exception covered in subsection ORS 90.532(2) provides as follows: A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method: (a) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010. (b) For sewer service, if it is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010. Translating this to plain English, here is my take: o For rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010 you may not convert water or sewer charges from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method except as follows: o Water service: If the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless you were using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010. o Sewer Service: If sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, you may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata method, unless you were already using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010. o Garbage service: You may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant. There does not appear to be any time frame limitation on this rule Pursuant to ORS 90.534 [Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area], if a written rental agreement so provides, you may use a pro rata billing method with a master meter and require tenants to pay you a utility or service charges (e.g. electrical and natural gas) that has been billed to you or provided directly to the tenant's space or to a common area. However, you may not unilaterally amend an existing rental agreement to convert utility and service billing from an in-rent billing method to a pro rata billing method. It appears you could use the pro rata billing method (other than sewer and water) per above rules, only on a going forward basis with new residents. Conclusion. This is the best I can tell you. It is not legal advice, and based only upon my interpretation of the statutes which are quite complex. It appears that yours is a difficult situation in which water/sewer submetering will not actually help. With the exception of garbage service, there is no easy answer.

Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees. While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees. With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner. Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business. Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem. In reality, however, it is. Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner. Accordingly, the statute allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner: Normal maintenance for trees on a resident's space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a hazard tree"" then responsibility shifts to the landlord - unless the resident planted the tree.

I have set out the law in its entirety below. As you can see, the law presumes there has been a violent act for which the landlord is evicting everyone in the space, i.e. the villain and the victim. The domestic violence law says you cannot evict the victim for the violent act. But it also says the villain and the victim are still responsible for rent. It also requires a valid third-party affirmation to the event. In short, based on your question, it does not sound as if the domestic violence statute will provide a defense to an action for nonpayment of rent. You should tell the victim that you do not believe the domestic violence law applies in these circumstances (i.e. nonpayment of rent) and that if her attorney believes otherwise, he must call you immediately and explain why. Is she is a serial late pay for which you have to issue multiple non-payment of rent notices, you might consider a 3-strikes notice under ORS 90.630(8).

(2) A landlord that terminates the tenancy of a perpetrator under this section may not require the remaining tenants to pay additional rent or an additional deposit or fee due to exclusion of the perpetrator. (3) The perpetrator is jointly liable with any other tenants of the dwelling unit for rent or damages to the premises incurred prior to the later of the date the perpetrator vacates the premises or the termination date specified in the notice.

Here is what the Social Security Administration says about your number:</p><p>Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America. A dishonest person who has your Social Security number can use it to get other personal information about you. Identity thieves can use your number and your good credit to apply for more credit in your name. Then, they use the credit cards and do not pay the bills. You may not find out that someone is using your number until you are turned down for credit or you begin to get calls from unknown creditors demanding payment for items you never bought. Someone illegally using your Social Security number and assuming your identity can cause a lot of problems.</p><p>Your number is confidential</p><p>The Social Security Administration protects your Social Security number and keeps your records confidential. We do not give your number to anyone, except when authorized by law. You should be careful about sharing your number, even when you are asked for it. You should ask why your number is needed, how it will be used and what will happen if you refuse. The answers to these questions can help you decide if you want to give out your Social Security number.</p><p>Oregon has the Identity Theft Protection Act which prohibits person's and companies who maintain Social Security numbers as a form of customer identifier from printing a consumer's SSN on any mailed materials not requested by the consumer (unless redacted) and printing a consumer's SSN on a card used by the consumer that is required to access products or services.</p><p>While there is plenty of information about how to protect against identity theft, the real issue, when must I turn over my SSN to someone who is asking for it? The list is actually pretty short, and somewhat expected. The major ones are: credit card applications (discussed below); cash transactions over $10,000 (required by the IRS 1); when applying for certain federal benefits; for U.S. military paperwork; for employment purposes; and, when applying for a license through the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles. 2</p><p>Your question focuses on credit card applications related to your business. For consumers, their SSN is almost the sine qua non for obtaining credit. In other words, if you refuse to provide you SSN, you can kiss your application goodbye. Armed with your SSN and virtually nothing else, a car dealer or other merchant, can almost immediately determine your credit score. However, providing it to your doctor's office or other provider may not be necessary. Much depends on whether you are on Medicare or Medicaid.</p><p>While it might be nice, as a business owner, if you could use your Employer ID number (EIN), if you had one, the issue is that when extending credit for small businesses, it is far easier to run a credit check on the consumer, i.e. you, that your business, which until recently, was not an option. However, in December 2013, FICO, the primary credit scoring company in the country, has opened up a service for small businesses. Here is what they say on their website here:</p><p>Getting approved for a loan is a major challenge for small business owners, but the reason they're denied credit is often kept secret. That's about to change as one key player in the credit scoring industry makes its small business scores available to owners for the first time.</p><p>FICO (FICO) scores are used as tools for lenders to determine the creditworthiness of applicants. Its general scores have been available to individual consumers for years, but its small business scores have only been disclosed to lenders.<br />Now, the service is partnering with companies like Creditera, an online credit monitoring system, to bring more transparency to the process. It won't be free, like many of its consumer scores are, but come January, business owners who subscribe to Creditera will be able to see FICO's Small Business Scoring Service measurement.</p><p>The change will allow small business owners to see how they're being judged by lenders, giving them a better idea of what kind of credit and rates they should expect.</p><p>Conclusion. Although this entire issue is beyond my legal knowledge, this approach, i.e. to obtain extensions of credit through your business, may enable you to use your EIN rather than your SSN. Since they are both 9-digit numbers, it may be possible to use the EIN rather than your SSN. In some business and tax forms, they are used somewhat interchangeably.</p><p>While this approach would not necessarily prevent someone from stealing your EIN, identity thieves typically go after the low hanging fruit, i.e. the SSNs, which are much more ubiquitous than EINs. Again, I admit I'm a bit out of my element on this question. I acknowledge that even getting an extension of business credit, may entail, at least initially, the use of your SSN. However, it may be worth a try, in order to see if, over time, when applying for business credit, you can use the company's EIN rather than your SSN.

Deciding when is the right time to replace them or upgrade is always a difficult decision. Will upgrading increase productivity? A new system can affect productivity in positive ways. In today's business environment many users have more applications open at one time and a new system with increased speed will have a positive effect on managing the time spent moving between applications. One of the obvious reasons to upgrade is your operating system is probably running Windows XP which was released to the market in 2001 and support for this system is no longer available. So not upgrading isn't even an option, it's a cost of doing business today. Advances in computers and software dictate that every few years you are going to need to make some upgrades. If you are eight years behind, this becomes a more formidable task and a larger learning curve. It's far better to continually upgrade your systems. The expense will be the same in the long run, but the result is that you will be more productive and ease into incremental training. These are all things to consider when determining a budget for your reserve account.</p><p>There are several capital improvements that can increase the value of your MHC. Filling vacant manufactured home sites is one. A vacant home site is costing you money to keep the lawn mown, the weeds removed and lot to be cleaned, not to mention the loss of revenue. It also can cause your residents angst having an unsightly empty lot next door. Putting together a strategic plan for filling your vacancies is proactive and critical. Be creative. For example, consider looking at a vacant single wide site that may be able to fit a double wide home by setting the home back and installing a front load driveway. Another is submetering water, sewer and passing through the garbage service expense. By installing water meters at each manufactured home and billing the resident's back for water, sewer and passing through the garbage you are in effect increasing your bottom line. This is one of the most equitable ways to pass on expenses to the residents as they only pay for what they use. Commonwealth can discuss with you how to install submeters with zero investment from you, the owner. Other ideas to add value is to increase curb appeal in your community and install new and attractive signs at the entrances. Maintain adequate energy efficient lighting to save on your electric bills while also promoting safety in the community. If you have vacant land, consider developing more MH sites, RV storage or storage units. All of these are things to consider when you're reinvesting into your community.</p><p>Tom Petitt<br />Vice President</p><p style=""font-size:.9em;"">Article provided by Tom Petitt, Vice President for Commonwealth.

This prohibition against commission sharing even applies between real estate agents and the homeowner they represent.

However, a real estate broker or principal real estate broker may pay a finders fee or a share of the licensees compensation on a cooperative sale when the payment is made to a licensed real estate broker in another state or country, provided that the state or country in which that broker is licensed has a law permitting real estate brokers to cooperate with real estate brokers or principal real estate brokers in this state and that such nonresident real estate broker does not conduct in this state any acts constituting professional real estate activity and for which compensation is paid. If a country does not license real estate brokers, the payee must be a citizen or resident of the country and represent that the payee is in the business of real estate brokerage in the other country. A real estate broker associated with a principal real estate broker may not accept compensation from any person other than the principal real estate broker with whom the real estate broker is associated at the time. A principal real estate broker may not make payment to the real estate broker of another principal real estate broker except through the principal real estate broker with whom the real estate broker is associated. Nothing in this section prevents payment of compensation earned by a real estate broker or principal real estate broker while licensed, because of change of affiliation or inactivation of the brokers license.</p><p>(2)Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prohibits a real estate licensee who has a written property management agreement with the owner of a residential building or facility from authorizing the payment of a referral fee, rent credit or other compensation to an existing tenant of the owner or licensee, or a former tenant if the former tenant resided in the building or facility within the previous six months, as compensation for referring new tenants to the licensee.</p><p>(3)(a) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prevents an Oregon real estate broker or principal real estate broker from sharing compensation on a cooperative nonresidential real estate transaction with a person who holds an active real estate license in another state or country, provided:</p><p>(A)Before the out-of-state real estate licensee performs any act in this state that constitutes professional real estate activity, the licensee and the cooperating Oregon real estate broker or principal real estate broker agree in writing that the acts constituting professional real estate activity conducted in this state will be under the supervision and control of the cooperating Oregon broker and will comply with all applicable Oregon laws;</p><p>(B)The cooperating Oregon real estate broker or principal real estate broker accompanies the out-of-state real estate licensee and the client during any property showings or negotiations conducted in this state;

The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs? Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies. We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services.</p><p>Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year. Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin. This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent.</p><p>A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense. You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption. This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption. Rates are high now and will continue to rise. A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities. All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility.</p><p>You need to be aware that your business is under attack. Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges. As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice: 1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment. This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list. The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing. The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees. Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing. The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"". I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity. The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law.</p><p>Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent. Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"". This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges.</p><p>One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states. We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another. Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide. Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense. Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board.</p><p>If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents. Commonwealth has a solution for accomplishing all of this with minimal cost to you.

In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class. Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation. For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area."" Then, how does this sound: ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ...."" Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families""). Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications). Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children."" Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA. Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA. There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling. The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory. In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted. Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy. These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households."" ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering. Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal. The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified""). The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules."" Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ...""). But where to set the limit is uncertain. California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning - No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high. In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement. Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above. Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear. The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools. Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity. While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability. The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed. Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed. Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities. It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision: A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision. Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under. The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children. The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles. Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules. Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time. For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2] However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example: Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age. See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3] However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community? It would seem that such a rule is reasonable. However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA. On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe""). The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules. This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol>	<li>Rules which bar use of a pool for children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the prohibition implements legislative policy. HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531 (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li>	<li>A rule which required children under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise equipment. (HUD vs. Trace Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li>	<li>Rules have been sustained for age restricted access as to power tools. ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18) years old when using the machine shop. Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li>	<li>In the unpublished decision of United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y. 1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an inclining board and a rowing machine - in its ""the fitness center."" Until 1992 an express policy restricted the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least eighteen (18) years old. After mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li>	<li>One case allowed for a rule requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in a street. U.S. v. M. Westland Co., CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)). Another authority states that no child should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years of age. (""Cycling should be restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road. Parental and adult supervision is essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached by each child."" The National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat."" The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate. That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers). The FHA prohibits discrimination, period. The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD. It is not the court's duty. The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules. HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations. Model regulations for protection of the young could be published. HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children. But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules. At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity. A conciliation agreement binds the complainant. If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule. This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity. The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved. The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety. The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept. The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do? Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth. When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made. For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service - disseminating information and facts - not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations. IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation. For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed. While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is! What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not. But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management. Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule? No. No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court. Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations. The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Enduring years of Landlord/Tenant Coalition, one of the most daunting tasks was demonstrating Landlords do not have safes' locked full of money. Financing options simply did not exist to fund mandatory sub-metering. Where were Landlords to find upwards of $750+ per homesite to install water sub-meters? Of course, Landlords proved their argument and negotiated the right to unilaterally amend rental agreements to permit community-wide sub-metering; creating provisions to recapture installation expenses by billing Tenants. Considering a new program now available, I believe every Landlord should sub-meter sooner than later!</p><p>Now available is a sub-meter and installation program at zero expense to any Landlord wanting to install new or replace old sub-meter systems.

In Eugene, this 3rd party charges nearly 1/2 less of what EWEB (Eugene Water and Electric Board) charges it's customers. Second, per ORS 90, the 3rd party bills the Tenant the cost of the sub-meter and installation over a minimum of 60 months. The sub-metering process is complicated; no worries, this 3rd party is experienced, has been in business for nearly a decade, has all the systems and sample notices in place, and handles the entire process on behalf of the Landlord.</p><p>The Bottom line: local government agencies and utility companies use Landlords to pass through their exorbitant ""fees"" and rate increases, in which Landlords are forced to carry until the next ""rent"" increase ... making the Landlord the greedy bad guy.

The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs? Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies. We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services.</p><p>Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year. Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin. This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent.</p><p>A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense. You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption. This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption. Rates are high now and will continue to rise. A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities. All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility.</p><p>You need to be aware that your business is under attack. Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges. As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice: 1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment. This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list. The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing. The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees. Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing. The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"". I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity. The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law.</p><p>Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent. Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"". This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges.</p><p>One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states. We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another. Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide. Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense. Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board.</p><p>If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents. Commonwealth has a solution for accomplishing all of this with minimal cost to you. Please stay tuned for more information about our recommended solution to help you protect the investment you have made in your business in next week's follow up article.</p><p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss this, please feel free to contact me at 503.718.0622, Christy Mays - Washington Vice President at 425.952.2750, and/or Tom Petitt - Oregon Vice President at 503.718.0620</p><p>Article provided by Adam Cook, President of Commonwealth Real Estate Services.

We live in a very litigious society and need to be aware of potential risks and ways to protect our assets. Commonwealth employees are insured through workers' compensation policies and also provided regular training regarding workplace safety. Another area we are striving to improve risk management and compliance is in the area of hiring contractors. When a contractor is hired, the onsite manager must obtain verification that the contractor is licensed, bonded, and insured. In addition, a Form W-9 must be provided for purposes of reporting non-employee compensation on a Form 1099-Misc at the end of the year.</p><p>The downturn in the economy resulted in many contractors allowing their insurance and licensing to lapse. We are currently working on two projects to confirm all contractors are still in compliance. The first will be a ""preferred vendor"" list by location. Commonwealth is compiling lists by geographic areas of approved vendors so in an emergency situation your onsite manager or regional manager knows what vendors have up-to-date information on file. Secondly, we will be combining this vendor list with our accounting program to alert us when we need to update the insurance information. The reason to remind our customers of this policy is that some may have ""tried and true"" contractors that would not be eligible to work at the communities unless they can provide the necessary information requested OR become an employee to complete the task you wish to hire them for. I mention the latter as it is a legal remedy to tackling some of the small jobs that may be better served by hiring specialized temporary employees through agencies. Another option is hiring an individual on a task by task basis for their special skill. Commonwealth wants to be sure we are doing our best to protect your investment by limiting your risk exposure, both legal and financial, associated with contractors working at your communities.</p><p>Another reminder is that we do send 1099-Misc forms to all contractors annually. The form 1099-Misc reports all non-employee compensation. Amounts paid for employee compensation are reported on a Form W-2. Employees cannot receive a 1099-Misc and Form W-2 from the same employer for similar work. In order to keep away from any proof of control issues, our company policy is to send a W-2 to all employees and make sure all compensation for that individual runs through payroll. All independent contractor payments are reported on a 1099-Misc.</p><p><em>Article provided by Kathleen Landau, Accounting Manager for Commonwealth Real Estate Services since 2009.

New lenders, including a multitude of conduit lenders, have joined the fray in anticipation of a large spike in the volume of maturing loans over the next three years. According to a survey released on January 13, 2015, by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), a relative measure of supply and demand showed that lenders were 50% more eager to make loans than borrowers were to take out loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most lenders and participants at the MBA's annual conference, which took place in February 2015, expressed optimism about the overall health of commercial lending markets and future growth prospects. According to the MBA, the amount of commercial and multifamily debt outstanding rose to a record high in the third quarter of 2014, and now stands at $2.6 trillion. New loan originations in 2015 are projected to be $414 billion, an increase of 7% from 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The following is an overview of lending alternatives and the environment we anticipate during the remainder of 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conduit Lenders</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The re-emergence of Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), and conduit lenders who originate these mortgages, has been a key factor in the market's recovery over the past three years. Conduit lenders originate and pool loans that are sold in the capital markets, resulting in attractive financing terms for a wide range of properties and borrowers. While conduit loans are not a good fit for every borrower, they play an essential role underpinning the market by providing lending options for properties that may not otherwise be eligible for competitive financing terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conduit loans have account for as much as 50% of total commercial real estate lending volume in some years. At the peak of the market in 2007, annual U.S. conduit lending volume was close to $230 billion. In 2008, however, the CMBS industry was all but dismantled until the second half of 2012, which marked the comeback of conduit lenders when investors (buyers of CMBS) once again became comfortable with underwriting standards and real estate exposure in general. Conduit loan production in 2014 totaled approximately $101 billion, which was an increase of approximately 19% of 2013, according to a recent issue of <em>Commercial Mortgage Alert</em>. Some insiders are projecting 2015 conduit lending volumes will be as high as $125 billion. CMBS and similar securitized loans currently account for 21% of outstanding commercial and multifamily mortgages in the U.S.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Multifamily properties are highly desired among conduit lenders who need a diverse mix of property types for their loan pools. MHCs in particular are in strong demand among conduit lenders since other lenders, most notable Freddie Mac and Frannie Mae, compete aggressively for traditional apartments thereby making it more difficult for conduit lenders to win that multifamily business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Government-sponsored entities</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac are the two government-sponsored entities (GSEs) that actively lend on MHCs. They have the directive from their regulator to enhance the flow of credit to multifamily properties nationwide. Fannie Mae was the most reliable lender, and often the only option, during the most recent lending crisis. On April 29 2014, Freddie Mac received approval from its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to begin lending on MHCs. This move is reflective of a more expansive role for the GSE's being signaled by FHFA director Mel Watt, who assumed office on January 6, 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FNMA loans are accessed through Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) lenders who are designated to underwrite, process, close, and service loans for Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac loans are accessed through its designated lenders, called sellers/servicers, who play the same role as Fannie Mae's DUS lenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GSE's offer very attractive terms, including recently introduced early rate lock options, and GSE loans now comprise 43% of outstanding multifamily mortgage debt in the United States. In 2014, FNMA and Freddie Mac provided $1.5 billion in financing to MHC owners, and we expect this to be substantially higher in 2015 since Freddie Mac was not lending on MHCs until the second half of 2014. In addition, MHC loans are excluded from GSE annual lending volume caps, which should further increase the GSE's demand for MHC loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life Insurance Companies</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life insurance companies (Lifecos) have an ongoing need to invest money in long-term, fixed rate investments with defined maturities, which includes commercial real estate loans. Lifecos purchase CMBS as investors, and also directly originate loans to borrowers. In 2014, lifecos originated $61 billion of commercial real estate loans, and account for 14% of outstanding U.S. commercial and multifamily debt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to MHCs, Lifecos continue to focus on higher quality, preferably age-restricted, communities in larger markets with financially strong and experienced borrowers. They generally pursue larger loan sizes ($5 million or more) at lower leverage levels than can usually be achieved with conduit or GSE lenders. Lifecos tend to have a pricing advantage for loans with fixed rate terms in excess of 10 years, and they also offer the ability for the borrower to lock rates at the time of application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Banks and Thrifts</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bank and thrifts hold the largest share, 37%, of outstanding commercial and multifamily mortgages in the U.S. assisted by the tailwinds of improving property values, bank and thrifts have addressed most of their bad"" real estate loans",Null,23,23,99999,0,100000,100001,23,1,1430317406,1431459686,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13004,16104,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Rules for Acceptance of Partial Rent,"<p align=""center"">&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Answer: &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>ORS 90.417 (Duty to Pay Rent) provides as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li><strong>Effect of acceptance of partial rent:</strong></li></ul><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">&nbsp;</p><ol>	<li><strong>A tenant's duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the <em><u>full amount of rent owed</u></em> within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement;</strong></li></ol><p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">&nbsp;</p><ol>	<li value=""2""><strong>A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.</strong></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol>	<li value=""3""><strong>A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent.

You would not be able to get any juvenile records. He probably has no credit to speak of, and his income is not necessary for establishing that his parents can afford to live in the community. It strikes me that going forward, you retain the same control over him as any other adults in the park. He has to obey the rules, etc., and if he doesn't you could issue a 30-day notice to the parents about his conduct. &nbsp;</p><p>If you wanted to add him as a Temporary Occupant, you could do that. If he violated rules, etc., you could terminate his right to be a Temporary Occupant, and require that he vacate.&nbsp; However, in this case, it does not seem that there is cause for concern.</p><p>&nbsp;If he had been a problem child, and now had grown into a problem adult, I would strongly recommend that you use a Temporary Occupancy Agreement. Your options in requiring that he vacate upon breach of the rules, are much swifter, although you cannot terminate without cause.</p><p>Although I don't believe I've seen this issue addressed in park rules, it's not a bad idea to have something in place. You could say that all children remaining in the park after their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, must do X, Y, and Z. That way, when it happens, you will not be accused of picking on one particular tenant's son or daughter.</p><p>Lastly, I've often seen a similar situation, where the child moves away after his or her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, and then returns a year or so later. Some landlords treat this as they would any other third party wanting to move into an existing resident's home. While it would be nice if the situation was addressed in the community rules, I have not seen this. I believe I would treat any adult wanting to share space with other residents, even parents, the same way I would treat unrelated parties; they must at least pass a background check. The rule should be the same for two residents who have been approved, then one leaves and comes back a year or so later.</p><p>In all cases, you can use the Occupancy Agreement, assuming the person passes their background check.

For purposes of my response, I will assume that one or both of these documents require that if a resident wants to have a person live with them at the home, they must so notify the landlord, get a background check and have management approval. If they are going to go onto the lease, then their credit record becomes important, and they would have to provide financial information as well. If the person will not be living there as a resident, then they could enter into a temporary occupancy agreement under&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.275"">ORS 90.275</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in your case, assuming that this person is actually a pedophile with a criminal record, he is not someone you want in the community under any circumstances. If he was a resident who signed a rental agreement or lease, Oregon law provides that you may terminate it by giving him not less than 30 days' notice if he is classified as a level three sex offender under ORS<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/181.800""><strong>181.800</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Risk assessment tool)</strong></a>&nbsp;(3) or is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/181.838""><strong>181.838</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Juvenile predatory sex offender defined)</strong></a>. (See,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.630"">90.630(1)(c)</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, this person is a visitor/guest - you are not legally obligated to permit him in the community if he poses a threat to other persons, or interrupts their peaceful enjoyment. You certainly do not have to give 30-days' notice for him to vacate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should promptly contact the mother and tell her that the son must leave.&nbsp; If you are willing to give him a short period of time to find other living arrangements, make sure that he is not loitering around the community.&nbsp; If this is a family park, I would not permit him much more than three days to be gone. He should be warned not to come back. If he and his mother want to visit, it must be outside the community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the mother refuses to cooperate, you should contact the local police, and ask them what protocol they would like to you follow to have him removed as a trespasser.&nbsp; In most cases, you would first issue him a written notice (with copy to the mother) informing him that he is not welcomed in the community, and if he comes back after a certain date, you will call the police and have him removed as a trespasser.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, this will resolve the matter. If it does not, either because he is seen still coming back into the community, you may have to issue the mother a 30-day notice under ORS 90.630 for violating the rules and/or rental agreement. The rule that would likely apply would prohibit persons from staying in homes as occupants or guests without landlord approval.&nbsp; In such case, you would have to issue her a 30-day notice for cause.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, until this matter is resolved, I don't recommend accepting rent from the mother (or son).

This can occur, for example, where someone is residing at the space under a Temporary Occupancy Agreement, but the approved tenant, no longer resides there. Alternatively, the person could be a lawful visitor, who has overstayed their permitted time, and the legal resident has left.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.403"">ORS 90.403</a>&nbsp;deals with this:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>&nbsp;90.403 Taking possession of premises from unauthorized possessor.</strong>&nbsp;(1) If an unauthorized person is in possession of the premises, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the cause and the date and time by which the person must vacate, a landlord may take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 if:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The tenant has vacated the premises;</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) The rental agreement with the tenant prohibited subleasing or allowing another person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the landlord; and</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;<em><u>The landlord has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession of the premises</u></em>.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Service of notice under this section does not create a right of tenancy for the person in possession of the premises. [2005 c.391 12] (Emphasis added.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, it can be fatal to a landlord's effort to remove that person if rent is accepted. If rent is in the form of a check, cash or money order, I can think of no reason to accept it. Period.&nbsp; Since the person is an unlawful occupant, I'm not concerned that there is no rule on it, since the statute clearly gives you the legal entitlement to evict.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other issue arises when a lawful resident resides in the space, but they have an occupant who has not been approved as a co-tenant or a temporary occupant.&nbsp; If you are going to accept them as a temporary occupancy, get them on a Temporary Occupancy Agreement. You can do a criminal background check, but not a financial one, since they are there not to subsidize the tenant's rent, as in co-tenancy.&nbsp; Accordingly, do not accept rent in any form from temporary occupant, unless it is drawn on the tenant's sole account and the check bears that out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As to unlawful occupants who are staying at the space, but have not been approved as a tenant, the issue of the form of payment misses the larger point - which is waiver. If the person is unauthorized, and you know of their occupancy, insist that they apply for tenancy, and make sure they do not stay beyond the time allowed for visitors under the park rules.&nbsp; The issue of waiver is not just a question of accepting a check from the unapproved person.&nbsp; Acceptance of rent from the lawful tenant when you know he or she is housing an unapproved person, can also result in waiver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.412"">ORS 90.412</a>&nbsp;provides in part:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(a)</strong><em><u>During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant</u></em>;&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(b)</strong>Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement.</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(3)</strong>A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(a)</strong>Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent;&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>(b)</strong>The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. (Emphasis added)</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p><p>So the take-away here is that you do not want to accept rent from anyone, even the tenant, when you know they are violating the rules, such as keeping an unapproved occupant at the space. If you accept rent from the lawful tenant under these circumstances, return it within ten days after receipt - if the check has been cashed, write a new check back to the tenant with an explanation, and demand that the&nbsp;unpermitted&nbsp;person apply for tenancy. Under the statute, waiver will not occur for the first two events of accepting the rent without returning is within ten days. The third or subsequent time can constitute a waiver. Waiver does not occur if the rent is properly returned within the ten day period, no matter the number of times it's tendered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for taking a rent check from the unapproved person, I don't recommend doing so unless the check is drawn on the tenant's own account. If it's a joint account with the unapproved person, don't accept it. The same holds true of any other form of payment (e.g. cash or money order) unless there is clear evidence that it came from the lawful tenant. Just remember, though, that acceptance of rent from the lawful tenant - in any form - can count as a waiver under ORS 90.412 if you know they have an unlawful occupant at the space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for a park rule, I think it's always a good idea to have a rule about the time, place and form of payment. It's OK to say non-residents cannot pay the space rent for residents, but even without such a rule, I believe you are within your rights to refuse payment. Rent is defined at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.100"">ORS 90.100(37)&nbsp;</a>as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Rent means any payment to be made to the landlord&nbsp;<em><u>under the rental agreement, periodic or otherwise, in exchange for the right of a tenant and any permitted pet to occupy a dwelling unit</u></em>&nbsp;to the exclusion of others and to use the premises.

Management is defined as The act of managing",Null,23,23,99999,0,100000,100001,23,1,1457450587,1512941679,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13140,16240,column,und,Avoiding Common Mistakes That Have a Big Effect On a Mobile Home Park's Cash Flow ,"<p><strong>Mistake #1: Rent increases </strong></p><p>A lot of times owners act as if below market rent is the same as earning a merit badge. It isn't. Having under market rent loses you money every month. If the property ever goes on the market, it will sell for less and maybe a lot less. Today a tenant isn't going to move because the rent goes up to market. Most tenants know what the rents are at other mobile home parks (often having better market rent intel than the owner). They won't be surprised when the rent goes up to market. If the owner is doing a good job of operating the mobile home park, higher rent won't be cause to move. When doing a rent increase, include the rent survey for your market, showing the rent charged at other communities. Also, be sure to factor in the water, sewer and garbage, if included in the lot rent. The water and sewer are probably $30-$60 per month per house- hold, depending on the city, and the garbage is probably $9-$15 per month per occupied site. If you are paying for these, consider how you may pass these utilities through. Be sure to factor in an estimate of water, sewer and garbage for the owners that pay it or the tenants.</p><p><strong>Mistake #2: Rent Survey </strong></p><p>What should the rent be? Not that many owners do annual rent surveys. If you have a manager, that should be their job. If there are owners of multiple mobile home parks in your market, look to their rents as a benchmark of the real rent. After all, these companies have to report earnings to shareholders or investors. They can't succeed by charging above market rents.</p><p><strong>Mistake #3: Holding On Too Long </strong></p><p>When you have a park owned home that isn't selling, it's time to let go, and get it sold or rented. Anyone that has been in this industry for a while and sells homes knows what it feels like to have an unsold mobile home that sits month after month with no offers. You market it, keep utilities on, pay insurance and cleaning, the staff shows it countless times and nothing. It's time to cut the price (ouch!) or do whatever needs to be done to sell the home. Each month that passes is another month of rent you'll never recover.</p><p>The same thing is true for mobile home park ownership. Sometimes the mobile home park property looks great on paper. After you actually own it, you find it's not your cup of tea. Maybe it's too far away from your office, the demand for homes isn't good, or a major employer shuts down, to name a few reasons why investors sell a mobile home park. In Warren Buffet's 2014 Letter To Investors, he freely writes about big mistakes he made early on with Berkshire Hathaway; mistakes that might have been deadly for the company.

My answers are in&nbsp;<em>italics</em>&nbsp;below.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</strong>&nbsp;<em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident - even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in.&nbsp; A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><em>Technically, yes.&nbsp; Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can - without your consent - alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed.&nbsp; [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p><p><strong>3. Do we&nbsp;rescreen&nbsp;the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so - if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?&nbsp; Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years?&nbsp; Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can - or will make the payments?&nbsp; That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced.&nbsp; Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved.&nbsp; The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent's individual credit score less important.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse.&nbsp; It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>If we do&nbsp;rescreen&nbsp;the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above.&nbsp; If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing - and I have never seen any that do - the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge.&nbsp; I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so.&nbsp; A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria - with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules - would be a very difficult sell to most judges.&nbsp; It is unlikely that you would prevail.&nbsp; I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out.&nbsp; If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict.&nbsp; But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent&nbsp;<u>in the future</u>, is premature and likely to fail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease.&nbsp; It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy. &nbsp;If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them.&nbsp;</em></p>",Null,23,23,99999,0,100000,100001,23,1,1464277999,1512942462,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13166,16266,column,und,Phil Querin Q&A: Security Deposits and Prepaid Rent,"<p><strong>Answer</strong>.

Unless you and the tenant have agreed otherwise in writing, you will waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent if you accept partial rent after issuing a 72 or 144 hour notice.&nbsp; The reason is simple: Oregon law says that you may avoid a waiver and accept partial rent, if the arrangement is set forth in a written agreement signed by both parties.&nbsp; Say, for example, that following issuance of a 72 or 144 hour notice to pay rent you enter into a written agreement with the tenant which provides that you will accept a partial payment of $100 on the 10<sup>th</sup> with the balance to be paid by the 20<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; If the tenant pays the $100 but fails to pay the balance on the 20<sup>th</sup> as agreed you may immediately file for eviction.&nbsp; However, your written agreement with the tenant should also include an express provision that if the balance is not paid as agreed - no new 72 or 144 hour notice will be required before filing the eviction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;

Briefly, the process is as follows: Not more than 60 days prior to the termination of the lease, the landlord must provide the tenant with a copy of the new proposed lease and rules.&nbsp; Thereafter, the tenant has 30 days within which to either agree to the new terms or to vacate and remove the home.&nbsp; If the tenant declines to sign and elects to vacate, he/she can try to re-sell the home in the park for up to 12 months, so long as storage fees are paid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one limitation on landlords - and not an unreasonable one - is that the new lease agreement or rules that the tenant may be asked to sign must be the substantially the same as those the landlord is currently offering others who are seeking to rent a space in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One&nbsp;<em>caveat</em>&nbsp;for landlords:&nbsp; If they fail to offer the new rules and lease agreement to the tenant on or before 60 days prior to expiration of the current term, the lease turns into a month-to-month tenancy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the use of leases under the new law will now permit landlords to unilaterally update their rental agreements and rules.&nbsp; We'll be talking about this in depth at the Annual Convention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Day Care Facilities.</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Frequently, community managers are confronted with tenants who seek to open day care businesses in their home.&nbsp; There are multiple issues involved here.&nbsp; First, is it a violation of the existing zoning laws to use the home for a commercial business?&nbsp; Secondly, will it impact the landlord's insurance rates?&nbsp; Lastly, what about increased traffic and risk of accidents?&nbsp; All of these issues militate&nbsp;<u>against</u>&nbsp;permitting tenants to open such enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Landlords should review their rules and regulations to make sure they have adequate limitations on day care businesses.&nbsp; If they do not, consideration should be given to updating the rules to make the appropriate amendments.&nbsp; However, for those landlords or managers whose rules do not address the issue, how is one to proceed?&nbsp; Oregon law provides that violation of the law constitutes a breach for which a curable 30-day notice of termination may be given. Accordingly, the landlord or manager should first check the zoning law.&nbsp; If it is a residential neighborhood, there may be zoning restrictions on such business enterprises.&nbsp; Also, even if there is not current restriction, there is nothing illegal about instituting a restriction of day care facilities immediately.&nbsp; Oregon law permits such rules, even if they make a material modification to the landlord-tenant relationship, so long as they are passed by the tenants in a legally adopted rule change (i.e. 51% or more do not object.)</p>",Null,23,23,99999,0,100000,100001,23,1,1490370170,1534198260,1,0,0,0,0chuck carpenter,13301,16401,column,und,What is Management?,"<p>Do employees know our management direction and is it consistently implemented?

May I assume the grandmother or her sister are at least 55 years old? If so, they qualify both as to the requirement that there be at least one occupant 55+, and as to the second person requirement. That should be the end of the age issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the babysitting, this is not a for-profit enterprise, so presumably does not violate any rules you might have for such situations. So all it is is family visiting, which is permissible under the rules. So long as the children are not staying overnight, I do not understand there to be a 30-day limit on this. If they do stay overnight, it appears there is a 30-day cap. But you don't say whether the 30-days is consecutive or cumulative. Unless there is some reason to believe the grandmother is lying about the children staying overnight (and even then, there is the 30-day rule) I don't see anything that suggests a violation.&nbsp; I know of nothing under the 55+ housing law that places restrictions on family visitors under age 55. In fact, as you may know, 55+ parks are permitted to have up to 20% of their spaces rented to families (which is not something should consider for a variety of reasons).&nbsp; However, the point is that the presence of children in a 55+ park does not, per se' cause the park to lose its 55+ designation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe this situation demands a practical approach. Is the babysitting situation causing a problem, e.g. noise, disruption, children in street, lack of supervision, etc?&nbsp; Are other residents complaining? If none of these consequences are occurring, I don't see a concern, or a need to start counting days, etc.&nbsp; If the situation is not being abused, I'd leave it alone. You may want to privately discuss this with the grandmother, just to make sure she understands that it is important that she monitor her grandchildrens' activity at all times, just to make sure other (less child-friendly) residents don't complain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The take-away here is that while rules are important, so long as they are not being abused, the need to be concerned primarily arises when there are complaints from other residents.

Answer: ""It depends."" If your community pre-dates the ADA statute, and the community has not gone through any significant renovations (determined on a case-by-case basis), then the community may be ""grandfathered in"" in most cases. However, there can still be considerations of ""reasonable accommodation"" and ""readily achievable barrier removal"" under the ADA that could require a community owner to make modifications to existing structures and to make existing buildings ""accessible"" to the disabled. There may be no ""grandfathering&nbsp;in"" under these provisions of the ADA. In addition, if the community has undergone substantial alterations/renovations, this could also trigger ADA compliance.<br /><br />The next question is whether a manufactured home community is a ""place of public accommodation."" The ADA defines a ""public accommodation"" to be ""a private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation."" Examples of places of ""public accommodation"" include: places of lodging; establishments serving food or drink; places of exhibition or entertainment; places of public gathering; sales or rental establishments; service establishments; stations used for public transportation; places of public display or collection; places of public recreation; places of public education; social service center establishments; and places of exercise or recreation.<br /><br />Does a manufactured home community fit under these descriptions? Based on discussions with ADA experts, the typical community does not appear to ""fit"" under any of the enumerated examples of a ""public accommodation,"" assuming the community's facilities are only open for the sole use and enjoyment of the community's residents, rather than the ""general public."" In some cases, however, a community's clubhouse and office could be determined to be ""public accommodations"" as they are generally ""opened to the public."" In addition, the community's office is necessarily ""opened to the public"" as persons, not otherwise residents of the community, are allowed in and, in fact, are invited in to inquire about available spaces and/or homes in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the community has ""public accommodations"" which have ""barriers"" to ""handicap access,"" then the next consideration is whether the ""removal of the barrier"" is ""readily achievable."" The ADA generally defines ""readily achievable"" as easily accomplished and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense. 42 U.S.C.S.  12181(9). Federal courts have developed several factors in determining what is ""readily achievable"": (1) nature and cost of the removal; (2) overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved; (3) number of persons employed at such facility; (4) effect on expenses and resources; (5) impact of such action upon the operation of the facility; (6) overall financial resources of the covered entity; (7) overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; (8) the number, type, and location of its facilities; (9) type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; and (10) geographic separateness, administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.&nbsp;<em>Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v.&nbsp;Hermanson&nbsp;Family Ltd.&nbsp;Pshp.</em>&nbsp;The community however will bear the ultimate burden to prove that the barrier removal is not readily achievable. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis for each individual community.<br /><br />So, how do you lessen the chance of your Community becoming a ""target"" of an ADA lawsuit? There are no ""bright lines"" as to whether a community has ADA issues or not. Since an ""ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" the prudent community owner might be best served by hiring a knowledgeable ADA Consultant to review and comment on whether the community has any ADA issues and how they should or could be addressed. Another, and more conservative approach would be to simply make sure that all of the community facilities are ""ADA compliant,"" even if, technically and legally, you may not be required to do so. Little things can make a big difference in your community. Examples of ADA compliance include: levers on the entrance doors; levers on bathroom doors and fixtures; bathroom fixtures at proper height; proper bathroom accessories; doorways that accept wheelchair access; bathrooms that accept wheelchair access; counters at correct height for wheelchairs users; alternatives (ramps/elevators) to steps into the clubhouse and office; acceptable transitions (no lips) at doorways (interior and exterior); handicap community and van access; acceptable transitions (commonly referred to as ""curb cuts"") to sidewalks at street junctions and handicap community; and acceptable inclines from community areas to public accommodations, to name a few.<br /><br />Your ADA consultant can walk your community and let you know what facilities do and do not comply with ADA. Making the necessary improvements will be money well spent, and potentially ""ward off"" expensive litigation, which litigation, in all probability, will not be covered by your general liability insurance policy. You might also want to turn this into a ""PR plus"" for your community - i.e., tell your residents about the improvements after they are done! However, such actions may not be right for every community. The community owner should first discuss ADA considerations with its legal counsel to determine what the right course of action under the particular circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rob&nbsp;Coldren&nbsp;is a founding partner of the MHI-member law firm of&nbsp;Hart, King &amp;&nbsp;Coldren&nbsp;in Santa Ana,&nbsp;Calif.&nbsp;For over three decades, Mr.&nbsp;Coldren's practice has emphasized representation of mobilehome parks, recreational vehicle parks, as well as park owners and managers.

While the landlord has certain responsibilities regarding the ground,<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>&nbsp;most of these duties apply at the time in installation of the home.</p><p>However, ORS 90.730(3)(g) provides:</p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">(g) Excluding the normal settling of land, a surface or ground capable of supporting a manufactured dwelling approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained to support a dwelling in a safe manner so that it is suitable for occupancy. A landlord's duty to maintain the surface or ground arises when the landlord knows or should know of a condition regarding the surface or ground that makes the dwelling unsafe to occupy;</p><p>In this case, I don't believe the landlord has a duty to backfill the eroded area costing thousands of dollars, but certainly should want to get the tenant relocated as soon as possible. If the home is not habitable due to the dangerous condition of the ground, I believe the tenant should be relocated immediately. If there is danger to the home and tenant, he/she should vacate, and resume occupancy only after the home has been relocated.&nbsp; In the meantime, I would not recommend accepting rent for a space that is dangerous or not habitable.</p><p>If the home is damaged, that is the tenant's responsibility to repair - hopefully he/she has casualty insurance.</p><p>In terms of timing, much depends on the severity of the erosion. As for the cost of the move, that is a good question. The statutes don't address. I believe it could be covered by the tenant's insurance company, if there is insurance.&nbsp; If not, and the tenant cannot afford the move, something has to happen. The landlord's insurance company may provide coverage, since it was a storm-caused event and affected the park's property. For example, if the storm cause a tree limb to fall on a tenant's home, the park's carrier would likely have to pay. It is not much different with water damage endangering part of the park occupied by tenants. Both water and trees causing storm damage are Acts of God, and this is exactly what liability insurance is for.&nbsp;</p><p>If there is no insurance coverage, I would suggest the cost be borne 50-50 between landlord and tenant, since both need the problem to be resolved, and the current statutes do not provide a clear answer. I suppose if the tenant refused - arguing that the space was created by the landlord, and must assume the risk of erosion along the waterfront - it might end up that the landlord should pay, just to avoid litigation.</p><p>If the tenant abandons the home, the landlord would proceed under&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.675"">ORS 90.675</a>.
