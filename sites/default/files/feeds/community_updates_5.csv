discusses the planning segment of disaster preparedness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;</strong>Learn all you can about the kinds of disasters that could possibly occur in your community  there may be some that you are not aware of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good resources for this information included your local emergency management office, the local American red Cross chapter or a state-level emergency preparedness agency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;"">For example, people at these organizations can help you lean whether your community is near a flood plain or a hazardous materials facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, did you know that all 50 states and all U.S. territories are vulnerable to earthquakes?&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oregon the risk

problems that might take place in your community, determine whether residents would ever need to evacuate or seek shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer is yes to either or both questions, prepare an evacuation plan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>Develop a master list of telephone numbers that you will need in the case of an emergency.&nbsp;This

Editor's Note: </em></u>&nbsp;</b>These&nbsp;new regulations out of Portland will only impact rental property inside the city limits of Portland. &nbsp;MHCO and Phil Querin will review MHCO Forms and make necessary changes in light of these new Portland regulations. &nbsp;Although these new laws do not impact the rest of the state, it does concern MHCO that Portland often sets the stage for future legislative action. &nbsp;We will likely be fighting this type of regulation in the 2021 and 2023 Oregon Legislative Sessions. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Oregonlive - Oregonian &nbsp;June 19, 2019</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Portland City Council on Wednesday adopted a slate of new polices intended to make landlords more forgiving of criminal records and poor credit when screening prospective tenants.</p><p>The council voted 3-1 to approve what its champion, Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, called the most comprehensive reform of its kind in the country. Commissioner Amanda Fritz cast a no vote; Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty was absent, though she expressed support Wednesday on her Facebook page.</p><p>A companion measure that requires landlords to more throughly account for security deposit funds withheld for repairs passed along the same line. That ordinance also allows tenants to pay security deposits in installments over three months.</p><p>The policy, which will take effect in March, is intended to increase access to housing for people who have been locked out of the conventional market because of years-old convictions or financial defaults. Its doubly needed in a city where affordable rentals are in short supply, Eudaly said.&nbsp;</p><p>Long-standing federal fair housing laws that bar discrimination against protected classes such as race, sex and familial status dont go far enough, Eudaly said. Red flags used by the rental housing industry to weed out problem tenants arent an accurate predictor of whether the renters would miss payments or violate their lease, she said.</p><p>Research and data have laid a solid foundation for the decisions we made, she said.</p><p>Fritz, the lone dissenter on the council, said she agreed with the goals of ending the disparate treatment of non-white renters revealed in years of fair housing audits conducted by the city.</p><p>But she went on to raise concerns about the lack of exemptions for violent crimes. And she said the policy as written would push landlords to sell their properties and developers to build outside of the city, ultimately pushing rents higher.</p><p>Many people can no longer afford to rent in Portland, she said before casting her vote. This policy not only doesnt solve for this problem, it may exacerbate it.</p><p>The ordinance sets low-barrier screening criteria for landlords to use when they evaluate a renters application. It would limit checks to felony convictions within the past seven years and misdemeanors within the last three years. Renters wouldnt be rejected for credit scores below 500, a court eviction order older than three years or insufficient credit history.</p><p>Landlords also can use their own criteria, but they must then provide written justification for denying a rental application.</p><p>Landlords have said few would choose the low-barrier screening criteria because it could put their property or other tenants at risk. But the alternative  providing written justification  will add to their administrative costs and push some landlords out of the business, they said.</p><p>In all cases, the policy would require landlords to advertise vacancies 72 hours before they begin accepting applications and to evaluate applications in the order theyre received.</p><p>And they cant require tenants to earn more than two-and-a-half times the monthly rent in income. Many landlords today require renters to make three times the monthly rent.</p><p>The official rules for the policy will be drafted by the Portland Housing Bureau, which will also provide an annual report on whether the rules are working as expected. Council members who supported the policy said the city would put on a robust effort to inform landlords and tenants alike of the new rules before they take effect.</p><p>The new rules add to a litany of renter protections and housing regulations put in place by the city and the state government in recent years.</p><p>Portland in 2016 mandated that developers of new apartments include rent-restricted units. In 2017 it began to require landlords to pay thousands of dollars to renters who move because of big rent increases or evictions without cause, a policy that remains the subject of a legal challenge.</p><p>This year, the state capped rent increases at 7 percent plus the rate of inflation and it banned landlords from evicting tenants without stated cause. In the cases where tenants can be evicted without violating their lease  to remodel or sell the home, for example  the landlord would have to pay the tenant one months rent to offset the cost of moving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",23,1,1561047611,1561047611,1,0,0,0,013589,16689,community_updates,und,Working with Residents in Disaster Preparedness (Part 2 in a series),"<p>This the second in a series of

and legal issues</li></ul><p>Depending on the size of your community, you may also want to appoint Block Captains, who will be responsible for maintaining data on their assigned neighborhoods and also be on call to warn residents in their area about an approaching emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your community has a large number of pets, you&nbsp;&nbsp;may want to include someone on the committee to focus on animals.</p><p><strong>There Are Two Major Roles For The Committee:</strong></p><ul>	<li>Educating and training all residents about emergencies</li>	<li>Actually coping with an emergency</li></ul><p>As a manager or owner of a manufactured home community, provide the committee with excellent materials to use in doing their work, starting with this series of articles.</p><p><strong>Committee Responsibilities:</strong></p><p>The chair&nbsp;should plan and hold regular meetings of the committee to review the work that is being done.&nbsp;&nbsp;He or she should be an active participant in other activities and lead by example.&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of an actual emergency, the chairman and the community manager will be the center of operations and communications.&nbsp;The chairman can assign duties to committee members, such as maintaining a list of community members with special needs or residents with special skills or expertise.</p><p>The training coordinator should be responsible for planning and holding actual evacuation or other types of disaster drills, depending on what potential problems face your community.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if the community has a central shelter that residents can use in case of a tornado, you should have a mock emergency alert once or twice a year.&nbsp;Encourage everyone to participate.&nbsp;This will improve their own safety, and it will also help you find out if there are any flaws in the plan, such as an area whose residents cannot reach the shelter quickly or a breakdown in the system used to alert residents.</p><p>These drills should also include practice with the notification system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Audio alarm systems should be tested regularly, and back-up systems should be practiced.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a phone chain is being used, it should be tried out at least twice a year, to see how long it takes everyone in the community to be notified and to make sure that phone numbers are current.</p><p>Similarly, with a door-to-door system, practices will help determine how long it takes to notify everyone, so that adjustments can be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;In either system, make plans that would allow for some residents not being in the community when notification is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, are some homes occupied for only part of the year?&nbsp;Would some residents be at work when you need to notify them?</p><p>The communications specialist is responsible for community education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular communication with residents through a newsletter or other publication is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to letting residents know about the communitys disaster plan, encourage families to develop their own disaster plans.&nbsp;Although not required by law, disaster plans should be provided to new residents as part of the move-in processing.</p><p>The emergency supplies person will work with the community management to establish a storage area for a supply of food, water, medical supplies, communications equipment and other items that would be needed in case a disaster strikes the community, and help cannot reach you right away.</p><p>The emergency supplies should be kept in an area that is unlikely to be damaged by any type of disaster.&nbsp;The managers should check these supplies regularly to make sure that they are usable and up-to-date.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of their individual family disaster plan, residents should maintain their own emergency supplies, and a way to carry the supplies (a duffel bag or suitcase) in case an evacuation is required.</p>",23,1,1561473893,1561473893,1,0,0,0,013591,16691,community_updates,und,"Fourth of July: What fireworks are legal, illegal in Oregon","<p>&nbsp;</p><p>By Jim Ryan | The Oregonian/OregonLive&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firecrackers. Roman candles. Bottle rockets.</p><p>These fireworks are synonymous with the Fourth of July. But it's against the law to light them without a permit in Oregon, and scofflaws can face significant fines.</p><p>With July Fourth on the horizon, here's how Oregonians can have a safe and legal blast on America's birthday, which is coming up next Thursday:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Illegal fireworks</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you have a permit, popular displays such as bottle rockets, firecrackers and Roman candles are against Oregon law, according to the state fire marshal's office.&nbsp;</p><p>The office says that without a permit, Oregon law prohibits the possession, sale or use of any firework that explodes, flies into the air or travels more than 12 feet horizontally on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone celebrating the Fourth up north (read:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cityofvancouver.us/fire/page/are-fireworks-legal-vancouver-washington"">Vancouver</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.clark.wa.gov/community-development/fireworks"">Clark County</a>&nbsp;or elsewhere in Washington) should research local fireworks policies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legal fireworks</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what fireworks are legal in Oregon? Not many.</p><p>Sparklers, smoke devices and fountains are a good place to start. Wheels and ground spinners are OK, too.</p><p>And if you happen to enjoy those little poppers that making loud noises when you throw them on the ground, theyre perfectly legal, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Just use common sense and keep a close eye on kids who are using fireworks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fireworks and public lands</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Areas where fireworks are forbidden include federal and state forestlands, as well as Oregon State beaches, parks and campgrounds, according to the fire marshal's office.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you're planning to celebrate with a camping trip or visit to the beach, it's probably best to leave the fireworks behind.</p><p>When in doubt, check with local authorities to see what fire restrictions are in your area.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Penalties</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We'll let the fire marshal's office take this one:</p><p>""Officials may seize illegal fireworks and charge offenders with a class B misdemeanor, which could result in a fine of up to $2,500 per violation and a civil penalty of up to $500. Those who misuse fireworks or allow fireworks to cause damage are liable and may be required to pay fire suppression costs or other damage. Parents are also liable for fireworks damage caused by their children.""&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fireworks from other states</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Theyre illegal too.

Wait 15 to 20 minutes then soak it in a bucket of water before disposal.</li>	<li>Be aware: use only legal fireworks and use them only in legal places.</li></ul><p>Pets</p><p>Your pooch probably hates the Fourth of July.&nbsp; The booms, blasts and lights that humans enjoy tend to terrify our furry friends. And the heat doesn't help.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Humane Society of the United States has advised owners to keep their pets away from fireworks, ask a vet for assistance if their pets are scared by fireworks, protect pets from heatstroke and get them a collar and identification tag. (Even indoor pets should have tags in case they try to escape the noise of fireworks, the nonprofit has said.)</p>",23,1,1562018396,1562089725,1,0,0,0,0
